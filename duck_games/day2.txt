[[DAY]]
DAY 2 — THE FEAST

The dorm doors unlock at the same time. A line of pale floor-lights leads them into a new room: a long hall with one enormous table, perfectly centered under brutal overhead lamps.

Plates slide into place by unseen hands.

Not “food.” Their food. The exact kind that hits a memory before it hits the tongue.

space_fan freezes. “No way… this is exactly—”
BLEUG! eyes her plate like it’s evidence. “Someone’s been watching me eat.”
Golden doesn’t sit right away. “If I eat it, it means I’m accepting the rules.”
Toad takes one bite, then exhales like he forgot how. “They got it perfect.”
Godly_Aura whispers, “This is data collection disguised as kindness.”
Smart2004 stares down his tray. “This is psychological warfare. Comfort as a leash.”
Snowlaris doesn’t touch anything at first. “It knows too much.”
CrystalWolf leans close to her plate and sniffs. “No poison. That’s… worse.”

Nightmare eats like it’s a timed challenge. “Food is fuel. Don’t overthink it.”
Elv takes smaller bites, counting. “It wants us calm.”
Rally taps the table once. “If the food’s real, the danger is real too.”
WavyDragons forces a laugh that doesn’t land. “So it’s a ‘welcome dinner’ for kidnapped people. Nice.”

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian : “Eat. Every favorite has a price.”

The speakers click off again—like the host stepped out of the room and left the door locked behind him.

More plates arrive, perfectly timed, perfectly tailored—like a hidden helper is walking a checklist of their souls.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 chews slowly. “I don’t trust gifts.”
KennBlueDragon (Rally) finishes first—too fast, like he’s racing the idea of being watched. “There’s paper under my tray.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur holds up his dessert like a trophy. “Okay… this is unfairly good.”
janhk. flips his fork, checking the metal. “Even the cutlery is selected.”

CharliSpirit swallows and whispers, “It tastes like home. That’s not okay.”
Schwonkey wipes his mouth. “Alright. Everyone stop. If there are rules, we read them together.”
Bofa watches the ceiling. “Rules are never for our benefit.”
Lysrix (she) looks sick with dread. “If it can do this… what else can it do?”
Revenant nods once. “We stay coordinated.”
Akarimmu sets his plate aside. “Read the paper.”
Acoustyx speaks quietly. “Read it out loud. So it can’t be changed later.”

Rally stands up, unfolds the sheet, and reads:

[[RULES]]
THE DUCK POND — STANDARD RULES (Orientation Set)

No running unless instructed. Running creates “incidents.”

No damaging lights (floor-lights, floodlights, or “pond markers”).

No crossing railings without permission.

No hiding during announcements.

No touching the water unless a game requires it.

If a door locks, it is locked for a reason.

Teams are absolute. Helping the opposing team counts as sabotage.

You may speak, bargain, threaten, or pray. The pond does not care.

[LORE ONLY: Rally’s Luck-Curse — he will constantly get into trouble, never be injured, and will only die when two remain.]

Rally lowers the paper. “That’s it. No exit clause. No mercy clause.”

The speakers crackle again—warmer, almost friendly.

“The first challenge begins now.”

A hiss slides through vents. Sweet. Heavy. Fast.

One by one, knees weaken. Plates blur. The table tilts sideways into darkness.

They wake to a soft elevator hum—individual compartments, dim and shaking, with a single strip of light on the floor.

Then the second voice enters the elevator speakers—low and calm, like it’s inside their skulls.

“Hunters and Ducks.”

It speaks the rules into them until the words stick.

You will be assigned a role: HUNTER or DUCK.

Hunters may cooperate with Hunters. Ducks may cooperate with Ducks.

Ducks receive oxygen masks. Hunters cannot steal or remove them.

Ducks may use underwater tunnels for up to 10 minutes per Duck.
(Time is tracked. The pond knows.)

Ducks cannot drag Hunters underwater. You may only fight, block, or force mistakes.

The game ends when a Hunter drowns or when a Duck is killed.

Step off the marked ground in the arena and you will learn why you shouldn’t.

Somewhere in the darkness between floors—

kiwi feels it again. That same chill, deep and wrong.
Snowlaris feels it too, and meets his eyes through the elevator’s dim glass — it followed us.

KennBlueDragon wakes sharply, grabbing the rail.
“Yeah… nobody drugged us just to be nice.”

The elevator jolts.

The doors open. 

They spill out onto a massive arena: a crystal-clear puddle the size of a lake, surrounded by glass walls and blinding lights. Beneath the water: faint shadows of tunnels that braid like veins.

A rack of oxygen masks waits near the edge—only on one side.

A panel lights up with roles.

The arena goes quiet—then everyone speaks at once, trying to pretend they’re not afraid.

Nightmare growls, “Hunters—tight formation.”
Elv nods. “Control the shoreline. Don’t chase into water.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 cracks his neck. “Let the ducks come to us.”
KennBlueDragon exhales slowly. “So we wait for mistakes… got it.”
space_fan squints at the tunnels. “Clear water doesn’t make this safer.”
Smart2004 points. “We mark tunnel exits. We trap the surface.”
Bofa mutters, “Rules that specific mean someone already watched this happen.”
lumallie whispers, “No trusting. Not even inside teams.”
Axlot smiles thinly. “If one of them pops up, I finish it.”

On the other side—

BLEUG! grabs a mask and snaps, “Ducks—don’t waste tunnel time.”
Snowlaris (to kiwi) “That voice… it’s here.”
kiwi swallows. “Yeah. And it knows our moves.”
Lysrix adjusts her mask straps with shaking hands. “Ten minutes. Don’t panic-burn it.”
Ut crouches at the waterline. “Tunnels mean flanks. We can appear anywhere.”
janhk. squints into the water. “The tunnels have turns. It’s a maze.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “Please tell me this ends without… that.”
Shroud says quietly, “It won’t.”

The floodlights intensify.

The water goes perfectly still.

And somewhere under the surface, something moves—

like the pond is smiling. 
A horn detonates over the arena—so loud the glass walls vibrate.

The match is live.

Hunters spread exactly as planned: a hard line on the shoreline, eyes on the water, backs to the glass.

Nightmare barks, “Hold the edge. Don’t step in.”
Elv points low, “Watch the shadows. They’ll surface where you’re weakest.”
WavyDragons mutters, “I hate water games.”
Smart2004 drags a marker line in the wet sand, “Exit points. Memorize them.”
Bofa keeps scanning the tunnels, “They’re not gone. They’re just underneath.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 cracks his neck, “Let them try something.”
lumallie whispers, “No hero plays.”
Revenant nods, “We move as one.”
space_fan steadies herself, “If I see bubbles, I call it.”
Golden shifts stance, “They want panic. Don’t give it.”
Acoustyx says quietly, “Listen. Even water has footsteps.”
Akarimmu rolls shoulders, “If one surfaces, we collapse.”
Axlot smiles thinly, “Surface kills only.”
KennBlueDragon keeps voice low, “Nobody gets separated.”
Godly_Aura watches the water, “Patterns. Find the pattern.”
Schwonkey swallows, “I’m not dying in a puddle.”

On the other side, Ducks move like a silent current.

BLEUG! snaps a mask on, “No wasted tunnel time.”
Lysrix tightens straps, “Ten minutes. Don’t burn it.”
Snowlaris leans to kiwi, “That voice is still here.”
kiwi nods once, “I know.”
CrystalWolf murmurs, “We bait them. Don’t chase.”
Rally taps the lights, “We strike when they think they’ve won.”
Ninnginni exhales, “Alright. We dance.”
Loyal2Schwalb points at the glass, “No exits. Only angles.”
NinjaFlout bows once, “Then we become the angle.”
Ut slips to the edge, “I’ll watch their backs.”
Shroud says quietly, “Let them feel clever.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur whispers, “If I die, name a duck after me.”
Toad tests seal, “Tunnels first.”
JIKOSU stares at the water, “I hate that it’s so clear.”
CharliSpirit breathes in, “Okay… okay…”
janhk. squints into the depths, “The maze is real.”

For a while, it’s slow. Careful. Almost chess.

Then it happens.

JIKOSU slips on the wet lip of the shore—just one mistake.

Hunters pounce.

Nightmare lunges first, grabbing the collar.
Schwonkey pins the arms.
Godly_Aura holds the mask up, “Don’t let them drop back in!”
Smart2004 steps in, “We got one!”

For half a second, victory.

They don’t see the tunnel behind them open.
Water parts.

Twelve Ducks erupt out in a coordinated surge.

BLEUG! comes up first, “NOW!”
Snowlaris hits the shore, “Move!”
CrystalWolf drives shoulder-first.
Rally snaps, “Heads down—force the slip!”
kiwi and Shroud flank left, cutting escape.
Lysrix darts in, “Don’t let them breathe!”
Ninnginni shoves forward, “Into the shallow!”
Loyal2Schwalb twists an arm, “Fall.”
NinjaFlout sweeps a leg, “Clean.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur charges, “GET OFF HIM!”
janhk. surfaces last, “More tunnels—”

The Hunters stagger—boots sliding.

Ducks don’t drag them under.

They shove. Strike. Force mistakes.

Schwonkey loses footing—back hits water.
Godly_Aura reaches to pull him—slips too.

A shallow puddle becomes a drowning pit when no one can stand.

Schwonkey gasps once—water fills lungs.
Godly_Aura claws for grip—finds none.

Nightmare hauls himself back onto dry ground.
Smart2004 stumbles away coughing.

Two Hunters don’t come back up.

The alarm screams.

The horn blares.

The game ends.
The crystal water drains instantly.

Ducks scramble out. Hunters stagger back.

Metal shutters slam through the tunnels—one after another.

A muffled pounding echoes from below.

janhk. is still inside.

The last water disappears. The tunnel seals.

Breathing turns ragged… then silent.

The lights stay bright.

They always stay bright.

[[LOG]]

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 2

10:00 PM.

The arena doesn’t need a clock—everyone knows the moment the electric wall ignites on the far side with that familiar hum.

Nightmare snaps, “MOVE!” and the survivors lurch into motion.
Elv keeps the pace steady, “Don’t sprint into a fall. Keep breathing.”
Smart2004 points to the floor-lights, “Eyes down. Follow the line. No detours.”
space_fan limps but doesn’t stop, wiping water off her face with a shaking hand.
KennBlueDragon grabs someone’s sleeve and hauls them forward, “Keep going. Don’t look back.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “They were right there…” and forces her feet to keep moving.
Akarimmu glances over his shoulder once, “It’s closer. Faster tonight.”
Acoustyx doesn’t speak—he just listens to the hum like it’s counting them.
BLEUG! shoves ahead through the dark, “Stay on the lights. Stay together.”
Lysrix stumbles, catches herself, “I’m fine—just—keep moving.”
Snowlaris stays tight with kiwi, “Don’t separate. Not now.”
kiwi nods once, jaw clenched, “I’m here.”
WavyDragons pants, “I hate this place. I hate it.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 spits to the side, “When I find whoever built this—”
Rally looks back just long enough to see the wall crawl forward, “Yeah… no. Keep running.”
Golden mutters, “It’s herding us,” and doesn’t slow down.

The corridor opens ahead—dark, endless, only the ground lights to follow.

They don’t search for exits anymore.

They just run forward because forward is the only direction that isn’t death. 

Dorm doors slide open. No welcome. No announcement. Just silence and harsh light.

Toad checks the door seam, “Same lock pattern. Same trap potential.”
CrystalWolf whispers, “It ended the game the moment it wanted to. Remember that.”
Bofa stands near the center, eyes scanning faces, “Tonight is where alliances start. Or vendettas.”
Revenant tries to sound steady, “Rooms close together. No solo walks. If you hear a door—call it.”
Ninnginni sits on the edge of a bed, “So this is the ‘rest’ part. Charming.”
Loyal2Schwalb keeps shoes on, “If the floor-lights flicker, I’m running. I don’t care where.”
JIKOSU flexes his hand like it still hurts, “I’m not touching anything ever again.”
lumallie stares at the ceiling, “We’re being taught. Trained. Broken into shape.”
NinjaFlout speaks quietly to no one in particular, “Then we learn faster than it expects.”
Ut tests the hallway edge, then backs away, “No blind corners. Good. Bad.”
Axlot drags something heavy closer to his bed, “If someone rushes me, they’re eating steel.”
Shroud takes the farthest corner, “Trust is a luxury. Don’t spend it.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur places a rubber duck on the bedside like a ward, “If I’m going down, I’m going down with moral support.”

Small groups form without permission. Some by friendship. Some by fear. Some by pure hatred.

Doors close. Breathing slows. Eyes stay open.

One by one they lie down—still listening, still watching—

not trusting anybody.

Not even themselves.
