DAY 5 — THE FREE DAY

[[AUTHOR NOTE]]
Alive after Day 4 (Freeze Tag):
Nightmare, Elv, WavyDragons, Vanarknees 🇦🇷, lumallie, Acoustyx, Rally, space_fan, JIKOSU, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, Lysrix, kiwi, Polaris, Shroud

[[NARRATIVE]]
They are awakened before sunrise.

Not by a scream. Not by static. By soft light.

Duccarian’s voice arrives calm—almost reassuring.

“There will be no deaths today.”

Elv sits up slowly. “That’s new.”
WavyDragons squints at the ceiling. “That’s suspicious.”
Rally mutters, “He never gives something without taking something.”
Nightmare just smiles like he’s been promised entertainment.
Polaris says nothing. She’s already scanning corners.
kiwi watches her instead of the room.

The doors slide open.

A table rises from the floor—covered in fresh fruit. Real fruit. Bright. Clean. Almost aggressively normal.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur laughs, stunned. “Okay… that’s unreal.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 folds his arms. “It’s bait.”
lumallie studies the ceiling. “Kindness is never free.”
Acoustyx checks the seams in the wall. “No moving parts yet.”
Lysrix picks up an orange slowly. “I forgot fruit had weight.”
CharliSpirit smiles weakly. “I forgot it had color.”
space_fan lowers herself carefully, ankle throbbing. “If I’m dreaming, don’t wake me.”
JIKOSU rotates his shoulder once, grimacing. “I’ll take fruit over water guns.”

Each plate has a fortune cookie.

They break them.

Nightmare reads first. “Strength is revealed when tested.”
Elv: “Patience brings advantage.”
WavyDragons: “Trust your timing.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 snorts. “Persistence builds legacy.”
lumallie: “Adaptability is survival.”
Acoustyx: “Observation creates opportunity.”
Rally: “Unity increases resilience.”
space_fan: “Healing takes time, so watch your steps.”
JIKOSU: “Balance your risks and your body.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur grins. “Enjoy simple moments.”
CharliSpirit reads softly. “Kindness returns.”
Lysrix: “Hope grows quietly.”
Shroud: “Silence reveals truth.”

Then kiwi freezes.

Near a wall seam—upright in the corner—there’s a duck.

Not glossy. Not decorative. Still.

Its beak angled directly at him.

Polaris sees it at the same time.

They look at each other for a split second—

Gone.

kiwi opens his fortune.

“I am watching you.”

Polaris opens hers.

“The rubber duck is evil.”

They fold the slips immediately and say nothing.

They eat anyway. They laugh anyway. They pretend anyway.

Because Duccarian promised no deaths—so what could go wrong?

Sirens cut the air.

The doors open.

A conveyor belt waits beyond.

WavyDragons steps on first. “If he said no deaths, what could go wrong?”
Shroud murmurs, “That sentence always ages badly.”
Rally steps on with a sigh. “Forward, then.”

The belt carries them into a chamber with a sealed steel door and a huge red button.

JIKOSU stumbles—shoulder catches—hand slams the button.

The mechanism grinds to life.

Everyone shouts at once.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷: “JIK—!”
lumallie: “Why would you touch—”
Acoustyx: “Don’t panic—watch it—”
Elv: “Back up!”

The door opens.

Sunlight pours in.

Fresh air fills their lungs so hard it almost hurts.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur laughs out loud. “NO WAY!”
Lysrix steps into the light like she’s afraid it’ll vanish. “It’s real.”
space_fan inhales and trembles. “I forgot air could taste like this.”
Nightmare scans the horizon. “This isn’t escape.”

They step outside.

An island.

Sand, palm trees, open sky—ocean in every direction.

WavyDragons runs barefoot and whoops like a kid.
Elv follows slower, smiling despite himself.
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 throws a rock into the waves like he’s measuring distance.
Acoustyx tracks the tree line, eyes sharp.
lumallie stays half in shade, half in sun.
Rally tests the ground near the perimeter like he expects it to bite.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur spots a tiny duck-shaped chunk of driftwood and holds it up proudly. “Deino’s cousin.”
CharliSpirit laughs once—quiet, surprised.
Shroud watches the horizon like it’s watching back.
Polaris and kiwi stay together near the shoreline, eyes on the water.
JIKOSU flexes his arm again, muttering, “Okay… today’s weird.”

The second voice cuts through the wind.

[[RULES]]
RULES — FREE DAY

This is your free day.

You may explore, run, and play.

Do not attempt escape.

The nearest landmass is forty hours away by speedboat.

At the siren, you have five minutes to return inside.

Doors will close.

You will not be let back in.

Starvation is slow.

[[NARRATIVE]]
The voice ends.

For a while, they almost believe the lie of freedom.

They run, splash, sit in sun, eat fruit with sandy fingers.

Then—like all good things in this place—night falls at an instant.

The siren BLASTS.

Everyone jolts.

Rally shouts, “FIVE MINUTES—MOVE!”
Acoustyx points, “Door’s that way—don’t spread out!”
Elv grabs JIKOSU’s sleeve and pulls him into a sprint. “Go!”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 runs hard, teeth clenched.
lumallie stays near the middle, watching angles.
Shroud keeps counting heads under his breath.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur clutches his driftwood duck like it’s sacred. “Deino’s cousin, don’t fail me!”
Polaris yanks kiwi forward. “Don’t look at the water.”
kiwi nods, breath sharp. “I’m not.”

space_fan slips.

Her ankle buckles on wet sand.

She hits the ground hard.

The door is closing in the distance.

Less than thirty seconds.

space_fan stares up at the sky, breath shaking. “Okay… I get it. I’m dead.”
Nightmare doesn’t slow. He only glances once—expression unreadable.

CharliSpirit hears her.

CharliSpirit turns back.

Polaris shouts, “CHARLI—DON’T—” but CharliSpirit is already sprinting.

Her fortune cookie flashes in her mind: Kindness returns.

CharliSpirit reaches space_fan, grabs under the arms. “No. Not today.”
space_fan chokes, “Leave me—”
CharliSpirit grits her teeth. “Shut up and MOVE.”

Elv doubles back two steps and takes space_fan’s other side without a word.
Rally shouts, “HURRY—HURRY—HURRY!”

The door starts to seal.

WavyDragons and Vanarknees 🇦🇷 are already at the entrance with a massive rock they hauled together.

WavyDragons pants, “Timing. Trust your timing, right?”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 snarls, “PUSH!”

They wedge the rock into the door gap.

Nightmare steps in and, with a slow flex of his shoulders, shoves the rock deeper like it weighs nothing.

Nightmare: “A real test.”
His fortune cookie line might as well be carved into the moment.

Acoustyx snaps, “IN—NOW!”

CharliSpirit and Elv drag space_fan through with seconds to spare.

The rock grinds. The mechanism fights it.

Then they’re all inside.

The door finally slams shut behind them.

Nobody died.

Nobody is left outside.

For a moment, they just stand there—breathing, shaking, half-laughing, half-crying.

Lysrix touches CharliSpirit’s shoulder. “You did that.”
CharliSpirit exhales, voice tiny. “I couldn’t… not.”
space_fan swallows hard. “You saved me.”
Rally nods once. “Kindness returned.”

The conveyor belt carries them back toward the dorms.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur cracks a weak joke. “Free day review: eight out of ten. Needs fewer sirens.”
WavyDragons laughs, breathless. “At least the air was premium.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 adds, “Next time, we steal the sun.”
Elv finally smiles. “Next time, we don’t trip a button.”
JIKOSU groans. “I’m never touching walls again.”

They roll into the dorm hall still talking—

And stop.

A figure stands in the middle of the dorms.

A man.

Mask on his face.

Still as a statue.

Nobody approaches.

Acoustyx lifts a hand slightly—warning, not greeting.
Shroud goes quiet—his fortune cookie line becomes a rule in his chest.
lumallie takes one step back.
Nightmare takes one step forward.

Rally calls, careful: “Who are you?”

No answer.

CharliSpirit whispers, “Is that… part of today?”
Lysrix clutches her fruit like it’s a weapon.
space_fan leans on the wall, trying not to shake.
Elv shifts into a guarded stance.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur hides his driftwood duck behind his back like it’s contraband.
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 cracks his knuckles once.

The masked man tilts his head.

And then he speaks.

Same tone. Same calm. Same cruel closeness as the second voice.

“Hello, old friends!”

His masked gaze turns directly to kiwi and Polaris.

kiwi’s blood goes cold.
Polaris doesn’t blink.

WavyDragons whispers, “Why them?”
Rally’s voice tightens. “Do you know him?”

The masked man doesn’t answer.

He simply steps back—

and leaves as he came.

No footsteps. No door sound. No trace.

Gone.

The dorm hall feels smaller.

Everyone stares at kiwi and Polaris now.

Elv asks first, quiet: “Why did it look at you?”
Lysrix follows, softer: “What does it want from you?”
CharliSpirit: “Have you seen that before?”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur: “Is this… duck stuff?”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷: “Talk.”
Rally: “Now.”
Shroud watches their faces, saying nothing.
Acoustyx adds, “If it’s targeting you, we need to know.”

Polaris swallows. “We have no clue.”
kiwi nods quickly. “None. We swear.”

Most of them believe it.

Nightmare doesn’t.

He just watches, satisfied again—quietly this time.

No one calls him on it.

They go to sleep eating apples and leftover fruit like it’s a luxury.

Trying to enjoy their last moments alive.

Because after today…

they know the pond can wear the shape of kindness.

And kindness can still bite.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 5 — THE NIGHTMARES

The lights go out.

No special game.

No extra voice.

Just darkness and breathing and the soft sound of people pretending to sleep.

WavyDragons turns on his side. “If I dream of sirens, I’m suing.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 mutters, “If you dream, you’re lucky.”
lumallie keeps her eyes open longer than everyone else.
Acoustyx listens to the hallway like it owes him an answer.
Rally counts heads in his mind until it becomes a lullaby.
Elv stays still, patient even with fear.
CharliSpirit holds her apple core like proof she did something good today.
Lysrix whispers into the dark, “Hope grows quietly,” and forces herself to believe it.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur sets the driftwood duck on his bedside. “Good night, Deino’s cousin.”
JIKOSU shifts carefully, shoulder aching.
space_fan breathes slow, repeating, “Healing takes time,” like a spell.
Shroud doesn’t move at all—silence revealing truth, whether he wants it or not.
Nightmare smiles into the dark like he’s already waiting for tomorrow.

kiwi sleeps.

And in his dream, floodlights bloom over the platform again—Day 1 replayed wrong.

The upright duck stands behind the lights.

Watching.

Polaris sleeps.

And in her dream, the duck’s beak points directly at her, and the second voice whispers through the mask:

“Hello, old friend.”

Both of them wake at different times—heart racing—staring at the same dark corner.

Neither says a word.

Not yet.
