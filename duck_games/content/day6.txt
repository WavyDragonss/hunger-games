DAY 6 — THE HIDE AND SEEK MAZE

[[AUTHOR NOTE]]
Alive at start of Day 6:
Nightmare, Elv, WavyDragons, Vanarknees 🇦🇷, lumallie, Acoustyx, Rally, space_fan, JIKOSU, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, Lysrix, kiwi, Polaris, Shroud

[[NARRATIVE]]
Red light floods the dorms.

Sirens blare like the building is trying to shake itself apart.

They wake up tired anyway—like sleep happened, but rest didn’t.

WavyDragons sits up with a hollow laugh. “Yeah. This is the bloodbath day.”  
Rally rubs his eyes. “It was always going to be.”  
Nightmare stands immediately. No groan. No hesitation.  
Elv exhales once, steady. “Everyone breathe.”  
Polaris and kiwi exchange one look—brief, silent, already braced.

Breakfast isn’t a feast. It’s a warning.

Small portions of seafood. Cold. Clean. Measured.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 shrugs and eats. “I’ve had worse.”  
Lysrix pokes hers. “I hate this texture.”  
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur takes a bite, then mutters, “Deino would love this,” like the name is a comfort.  
Shroud eats without expression, eyes fixed on the red glow.  
lumallie swallows fast. “They want us light and fast.”  
Acoustyx watches the doors. “They want us moving.”  
JIKOSU forces himself to eat despite his shoulder. “If I pass out later, that’s on them.”  
space_fan chews slowly, ankle still not right. “I don’t like how today feels.”  
CharliSpirit quietly: “Nothing good starts with sirens.”  
Nightmare doesn’t speak. He just finishes first.

Thirty minutes later, two doors open.

A panel flashes names.

Door One:
WavyDragons, Vanarknees 🇦🇷, Polaris, kiwi, space_fan, Rally

Door Two:
Nightmare, Elv, lumallie, Acoustyx, JIKOSU, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, Lysrix, Shroud

They split, and the air immediately changes—like the building approves.

Door One leads to a bright room so white it hurts.

A rack of bright colored suits. Laser-pistol-shaped weapons mounted in foam. Clean, toy-like, wrong.

A speaker clicks: “Dress. Arm. Wait.”

Rally holds one up. “These aren’t toys.”  
kiwi checks the barrel. “It’s a trigger system.”  
Polaris stares at the suit colors. “They want us visible.”  
space_fan swallows. “They want us to be the monsters.”  
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 straps his on anyway. “We either wear it, or we die for refusing.”  
WavyDragons mutters, “Today’s generosity is a lie.”

They suit up. They arm up. They wait.

Door Two leads to a darker prep room.

Costumes in muted colors. Waistbands with numbered bands like player markers.

A speaker clicks: “Dress. Elevator.”

Elv ties his band tight. “So we’re the hiding team.”  
CharliSpirit’s voice is thin. “Hide from our friends.”  
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur whispers, “Deino… don’t let me die in a maze.”  
Lysrix forces a breath. “Okay. Okay. We can do hiding.”  
Shroud looks at the waistband like it’s a collar. “Silence reveals truth,” he murmurs, and says nothing else.  
lumallie’s jaw tightens. “If I get found, don’t try to be brave.”  
Acoustyx checks seams and corners out of habit. “Walls move here. Always.”  
JIKOSU flexes his shoulder once. “If I can’t run, I’m done.”  
Nightmare smiles. “Then don’t get caught.”

They step into the elevator.

It descends slowly, screeching, then stops with a cheerful little ti-ding.

The doors open.

A maze stretches out—high walls, clean corridors, hiding alcoves marked with symbols.

A big plaque reads:

THE HIDE AND SEEK MAZE

A rules board lights up on both sides.

[[RULES]]
RULES — THE HIDE AND SEEK MAZE

HIDERS:
You must hide and make no sound.

You may change position after 10 minutes.

When the lights are OFF, you may move freely.

When the lights turn ON, you must freeze and take no more than 10 steps total.

You may use designated hiding spaces.

No attacking the Seekers.

No snitching. Snitches get stitches.

Breaking any rule results in elimination.

SEEKERS:
To eliminate a Hider, point your pistol and fire.

The shot delivers an instant lethal electrical shock.

If you see a Hider, you must shoot.

You may spare ONE person total.

Spared players are not protected from other Seekers, or from being found again.

No physical attacks.

THE GAME ENDS AFTER 2 HOURS.

Hour 1: Hiders hide.

Hour 2: Seekers enter and hunt.

[[NARRATIVE]]
Hour 1 begins.

The lights dim.

The maze hums softly.

They scatter.

Elv takes CharliSpirit with him at first. “Breathe. Small steps.”  
CharliSpirit nods, swallowing panic. “I owe space_fan… I’m not dying today.”  
Lysrix and GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur duck into an alcove together.  
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur clutches his waistband and whispers, “Deino, if you’re real, now would be a good time.”  
Lysrix hisses back, “Stop talking.”  
Shroud slips into a corner shadow and becomes part of the wall.  
Acoustyx chooses a false panel spot and tests it with his palm—then stays perfectly still.  
lumallie moves alone, quiet as a thought.  
JIKOSU tries to take a deeper corridor, but his shoulder makes him wince and he slows.  
Nightmare doesn’t hide with anyone—he finds a sightline like he’s already planning for the second hour.

Hour 1 ends.

A siren. A countdown. A door unlock.

And the Seekers enter in bright suits like neon warnings.

Rally’s voice comes out rough. “Two hours.”  
space_fan grips her pistol with both hands. “I hate this.”  
Polaris checks her corners like a soldier. “Don’t hesitate. Hesitation kills us too.”  
kiwi’s mouth is dry. “If I see Elv…”  
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 laughs once, bitter. “Then you do what the rules say.”  
WavyDragons raises his pistol and looks sick. “This is what they wanted.”

Lights flicker OFF.

Hiders run—silent, fast.

Then ON.

Freeze.

A corridor breathes.

Shroud shifts one inch too late—panic, instinct, a foot scrape.

The sound carries.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 turns instantly.

He sees Shroud in a shallow alcove, eyes wide.

Shroud’s lips move: “Silence—”

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 fires.

Shroud drops without a sound.

WavyDragons flinches hard. “Jesus—”  
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 doesn’t look away. “You want me dead for following the rules?”

Minutes later, Rally spots motion at the end of a corridor—JIKOSU trying to reposition as the lights pulse.

JIKOSU freezes too late.

Rally sees his face. Sees the injured shoulder. Sees the fear.

Rally raises the pistol.

JIKOSU whispers, “Do it.”

Rally’s hands shake.

Then he forces the gun down.

Rally, low: “I’m using my spare.”  
He swallows hard. “Freeze. Don’t move. Don’t make me see you twice.”

JIKOSU nods once—tiny, terrified—and locks still.

Rally turns away fast, like staying would break him.

The lights go OFF again.

WavyDragons rounds a corner—and Lysrix is there, pressed to a wall, breath too loud, eyes shining in the dark.

When the lights snap ON, Lysrix flinches.

One step.

Two.

Too many.

WavyDragons sees it happen and flinches like he’s been hit.

He aims anyway.

Lysrix stares at him, mouth open.

WavyDragons whispers, “I’m sorry.”

He fires.

Lysrix drops instantly.

WavyDragons staggers back, shaking. “No deaths today,” he mutters, voice cracking. “Right. Sure.”

Elsewhere, space_fan sweeps a corridor and hears CharliSpirit’s breathing behind a wall gap.

She stops.

She aims.

CharliSpirit squeezes her eyes shut, waiting.

space_fan’s fortune cookie message is still in her head, but the moment from yesterday is louder—CharliSpirit’s arms under hers, the pull, the refusal.

Kindness returns.

space_fan lowers the pistol.

Barely audible: “Go. When lights go off. Don’t make me see you again.”

She steps away.

Polaris catches the edge of a false panel—Acoustyx.

He freezes perfectly when the lights turn ON.

Polaris recognizes him anyway—too calm, too practiced.

Her finger tightens.

She fires.

Acoustyx drops behind the panel gap like a string cut.

kiwi hears the shot and his stomach turns. “Polaris…”  
Polaris doesn’t answer.

Later, kiwi finds Elv.

Elv is crouched behind a corner, motionless, eyes steady.

kiwi raises the pistol.

Then lowers it.

“That’s my spare,” kiwi whispers. “Move only when it’s dark.”

Elv nods once and disappears into stillness.

The siren sounds.

Two hours complete.

Maze walls begin to drop.

Not gently.

They sink fast, revealing everyone—alive or not—like the maze is tired of pretending.

Then the structure shifts.

Walls start sliding inward toward the center, forcing the survivors onto the guiding floor-lights.

Nobody argues. Nobody fights it. They just walk where it tells them.

They spill into a final room.

And there he is.

The masked man.

Waiting in the center like he owns the air.

WavyDragons sees him and snaps.

“That’s it.”

He charges.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 shouts, “Wavy—DON’T—”  
Rally grabs at him and misses.  
space_fan flinches back.  
kiwi and Polaris freeze—pure instinct.

WavyDragons reaches the masked man—

And stops.

Like he hit an invisible wall.

The masked man raises one hand.

WavyDragons lifts off the ground, choking, feet kicking once, then twice.

Polaris screams, “STOP!”  
kiwi lunges forward and can’t cross the line.

WavyDragons goes still.

A brief flash of heat—

and he’s gone, incinerated so completely there isn’t even ash.

The masked man’s voice is the second voice—no doubt left.

“This is just the beginning, kiwi and Polaris…”

He tilts his head, amused.

Then he leaves laughing—soft, evil, satisfied—vanishing like a glitch in reality.

The room breaks.

space_fan collapses to her knees, shaking.  
Rally stares at the empty spot where WavyDragons was, whispering, “No deaths today… was a lie.”  
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 punches the wall once and roars in grief.  
Elv stands rigid, staring at kiwi and Polaris like he finally understands why they were targeted.  
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur clutches his waistband and whispers, “Deino…”  
CharliSpirit trembles, whispering, “I’m sorry… I’m sorry…”  
lumallie sits down hard, hollow-eyed, like a piece of him never came back from the maze.  
Nightmare says nothing.

But his eyes are bright.

[[NARRATIVE]]
They are not given time to mourn properly.

The alarm hits again—short, sharp, commanding.

A new order without words: move.

Guiding floor-lights ignite.

They follow like ghosts.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 6 — NO SLEEP

The path delivers them back to the dorms.

Doors slide open.

Beds wait.

Nobody moves toward them.

Nobody can.

They did it.

They hunted their own friends through walls.

They watched people drop like switches being flipped.

They watched WavyDragons vanish like a punishment for having a spine.

The air feels thin.

Rally sits on the floor, back against a bedframe, staring at his hands. “I spared one.”  
His voice shakes. “And it still didn’t matter.”

space_fan hugs her knees. “Charli… I— I almost—”  
CharliSpirit’s eyes are wet. “But you didn’t.”  
She whispers it like a rope thrown across a cliff. “You didn’t.”

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 paces until his legs fail, then he sits hard and shakes with anger. “They made me do it.”  
Elv answers quietly, “They gave you a hallway and a rule. They made you choose.”  
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 spits, “Same thing.”

lumallie stares at the ceiling like it’s a judge. “It won’t get easier.”  
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur nods, barely breathing. “It gets worse. That’s the design.”  
Nightmare finally speaks, almost amused. “Then adapt.”

Polaris doesn’t look away from the darkest corner of the room.  
kiwi stays beside her, too close to be casual.

Shroud’s silence is gone.

Lysrix’s voice is gone.

Acoustyx’s calm is gone.

WavyDragons is gone.

And the masked man is still out there somewhere, laughing.

Rally’s voice turns firmer, cracked but real. “We can’t keep doing this.”  
Elv nods once. “Then we do something.”  
space_fan whispers, “Or we die.”  
CharliSpirit adds, “Or we lose ourselves first.”

No one sleeps.

They just lie down with eyes open, listening to each breath like it’s a countdown.

Because after today, they all understand the same truth:

If they don’t change something soon—

the pond will finish changing them.
