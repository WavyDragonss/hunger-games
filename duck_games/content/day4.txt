[[DAY]]
DAY 4 â€” FREEZE TAG

A harsh alarm drills through the dorms. Not the usual staticâ€”this one is sharp, mechanical, impatient.

Everyone sits up at once.

And for the first time since Day 1, thereâ€™s something new on the wall:

A huge red digital clock.

12:00 PM.

Elv squints at it. â€œA clockâ€¦ now?â€
WavyDragons rubs his eyes. â€œSo they can tell time when they want.â€
Rally stares without blinking. â€œThat means schedules. That means pacing.â€
Polaris keeps her voice low to kiwi. â€œIt feels like a countdown.â€
kiwi nods once. â€œOr a threat.â€

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian: â€œClean up. Reset. Youâ€™ve earned the privilege of pretending youâ€™re normal.â€

A dispensing bin opens with a hiss.

Nightmare shoves his old clothes in like heâ€™s throwing away a bad memory.
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· drops his in without looking. â€œIâ€™m not letting this place keep pieces of me.â€
lumallie folds her shirt once before tossing it. â€œItâ€™s collecting. That bin is a mouth.â€
Acoustyx watches the bin a second too long. â€œDonâ€™t put your hand in.â€

Theyâ€™re directed one at a time into a dressing room.

space_fan limps in first, jaw tight, and comes out in clean clothes that donâ€™t fit the pain.
KennBlueDragon goes next, rolling his shoulders. â€œFresh fabric, same prison.â€
CharliSpirit comes out quieter than she went in. â€œThis feels like theyâ€™re dressing us for a photo.â€
Lysrix checks her sleeves twice, like they might be marked.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur comes out holding his clean shirt like itâ€™s evidence. â€œThis is way too organized.â€
Shroud says nothingâ€”only looks at the clock again, and again.

Food arrives. Better. Not favorites. Not a trap-feast. Justâ€¦ decent.

Smart2004 eats fast, eyes scanning. â€œTheyâ€™re refueling us for something.â€
Bofa pushes his tray away, then forces himself to eat anyway. â€œFine. Iâ€™m not giving them the satisfaction.â€
Loyal2Schwalb murmurs, â€œThis is the first normal bite Iâ€™ve had in days.â€
Ut exhales like he forgot food could taste like food.
Axlot taps the table. â€œIf theyâ€™re feeding us, they want us running.â€
Revenant nods once. â€œOr screaming.â€

The day crawls.

No games. No announcements. Just the clock burning red.

12:00â€¦ 1:00â€¦ 2:00â€¦ 3:00â€¦ 4:00â€¦

Polaris catches herself staring at the reflection in the clockâ€™s glossy casingâ€”just for a secondâ€”like she expects to see something behind her.
kiwi notices and doesnâ€™t ask. He just shifts closer.

Then the clock flips.

5:00 PM.

The alarm slams down again.

The lights snap offâ€”only guiding floor-lights remain.

The second voice slides in, calm and delighted.

â€œFreeze Tag.â€

Silence. Then it begins laying rules like bricks.

[[RULES]]

RULES â€” FREEZE TAG

Four Catchers. Everyone else: Runners.

If you are tagged, you freeze instantly.

A Runner can unfreeze you by touching you and counting three seconds out loud.

If nobody unfreezes you within 30 seconds, you are eliminated.

If you move while frozen, you are eliminated.

If you attack a Catcher, you are eliminated.

No hiding. No crawling into vents. No leaving the arena.

Catchers may not camp a frozen Runner. Keep moving.

Catchers may not freeze everyone at once. One tag at a timeâ€”spread the pressure.

If you have been tagged once, you cannot be tagged again for three minutes after being unfrozen.

The game lasts one hour.

Every 20 minutes, Catchers and Runners may agree to a 5-minute truce. During truce, nobody can be tagged.

Reach the end of the hour alive.

[[NARRATIVE]]

A pause.

â€œBegin.â€

The doors open.

Theyâ€™re guided into a massive indoor arenaâ€”bright, sterile, wrong.

Inflatable duck barriers. Tall foam reeds. Glossy floor lanes that funnel movement. Duck-faced cameras watching from above.

A panel lights up with roles.

CATCHERS (4):
Nightmare
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
lumallie
Acoustyx

Nightmare cracks his neck. â€œAlright.â€
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· smiles without warmth. â€œRun.â€
lumallie whispers, â€œDonâ€™t blame me. Blame the rules.â€
Acoustyx says quietly, â€œKeep your hands to yourself. I wonâ€™t warn twice.â€

RUNNERS:
Elv, Rally, WavyDragons, KennBlueDragon, space_fan, Smart2004, Bofa, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, Lysrix, Revenant, BLEUG!, Loyal2Schwalb, kiwi, Polaris, JIKOSU, Ut, Axlot, Shroud

Rally exhales. â€œOne hour.â€
JIKOSU flexes his bad shoulder. â€œIâ€™m cooked if I get tagged.â€
space_fan tightens her brace. â€œIf I go down, donâ€™t stop for me.â€
Polaris snaps back, â€œDonâ€™t say that.â€
kiwi points to lanes. â€œWe rotate. We donâ€™t bunch.â€
Elv nods. â€œPair system. Always two.â€
Shroud murmurs, â€œThey want panic traffic jams.â€
Lysrix swallows. â€œThen we donâ€™t give them one.â€
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur looks around for a duck with a name and finds none. â€œThis place hates joy.â€
CharliSpirit whispers, â€œI hate that Iâ€™m already counting seconds.â€
Revenant raises his voice. â€œIf someone freezesâ€”call it. Loud.â€

A horn blares.

Nightmare launches firstâ€”fast, direct. Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· cuts angles. lumallie stalks like a shadow. Acoustyx moves like he already knows where people will run.

They scatter.

BLEUG! misjudges the first lane changeâ€”Nightmareâ€™s hand taps her shoulder.

She locks solid mid-step.

BLEUG! yells, â€œUNFREEZEâ€”â€ and her eyes flick wildly as the seconds start eating her.

Smart2004 runs for her, but Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· slides between like a wall.

Smart2004 snarls, â€œMove.â€
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· laughs once. â€œCanâ€™t camp. Iâ€™m justâ€¦ passing by.â€

Polaris starts toward BLEUG!â€”then lumallie appears, forcing her to veer.

Polaris breathes, â€œNoâ€”noâ€”â€
kiwi grabs her sleeve. â€œNot you. If you go frozen too, itâ€™s two gone.â€

BLEUG! hits 30 seconds.

A duck-camera clicks. A cold hiss bursts from overhead.

BLEUG! is flash-frozen into a brittle statueâ€”then collapses into glittering shards that melt into nothing.

The second voice purrs: â€œEliminated.â€

space_fan flinches hard. â€œTheyâ€™re not â€˜out.â€™ Theyâ€™re dead.â€

WavyDragons backs up. â€œOkay. Okay. No mistakes.â€

Smart2004 tries to take command again, shouting routes.

Acoustyx tags him mid-sentence.

Smart2004 freezes with one hand still raised like he can command time itself.

Revenant sprints in. â€œIâ€™ve got youâ€”â€

Smart2004 tries to point while frozenâ€”just a twitch.

The second voice cuts in instantly: â€œMoving while frozen is forbidden.â€

A duck nozzle snaps toward Smart2004.

The same cold hiss.

Smart2004 is erased in a heartbeat.

Revenant staggers back, horrified. â€œHe barely moved.â€

Rally mutters, â€œIt doesnâ€™t care how small.â€
Shroud says quietly, â€œIt cares that it can.â€

Bofa sees lumallie cornering CharliSpirit and loses it.

Bofa lungesâ€”an attack.

Acoustyx doesnâ€™t even have to move.

The second voice speaks like a judge: â€œAttacking a Catcher is forbidden.â€

Bofa freezes in place without being touchedâ€”like the arena itself grabbed him.

Bofa spits, â€œAre you kiddingâ€”â€

He doesnâ€™t get the rest out.

Cold hiss. Click. Gone.

CharliSpirit whispers, â€œBofaâ€”â€ and forces herself to keep running.

At 20 minutes, the horn blares twice.

Nightmare slows. â€œTruce?â€

Elv shouts from across the arena, breath ragged. â€œYes. Truce.â€

Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· rolls his shoulders. â€œFive minutes. Donâ€™t waste it.â€

The lights shift slightlyâ€”like even the arena relaxes.

JIKOSU drops to one knee, clutching his shoulder. â€œIâ€™m not making another forty minutes like this.â€
Lysrix sits hard against a barrier. â€œI canâ€™t feel my hands.â€
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur wipes his face. â€œThis is cardio for nightmares.â€
Polaris checks kiwiâ€™s face. â€œYou okay?â€
kiwi nods, but his eyes flick once to a corner where a duck-shaped camera seems angled too perfectly. â€œYeah. Iâ€™m okay.â€

space_fan adjusts her ankle brace tighter. â€œIf I get tagged, donâ€™t hesitate. Count fast.â€
KennBlueDragon answers, â€œI wonâ€™t hesitate.â€

Truce ends.

The chase restarts.

Loyal2Schwalb gets clipped by Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· at a lane intersection.

He freezes, eyes wide.

Loyal2Schwalb says, â€œPleaseâ€”â€ like it matters.

Polaris and kiwi both move at once.

Acoustyx cuts off kiwiâ€™s approach.

Acoustyx: â€œKeep running.â€
kiwi grits his teeth and pivots away, furious.

Polaris tries to reach Loyal2Schwalbâ€”but Nightmareâ€™s path forces her to break away or be tagged too.

Polaris hisses, â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€”â€

30 seconds.

Loyal2Schwalb is gone in cold glitter.

CharliSpirit covers her mouth. â€œNoâ€¦â€

Ut gets tagged nextâ€”lumallie taps him with almost gentle precision.

Ut freezes mid-stride.

Revenant calls out, â€œUT, HOLDâ€”HOLDâ€”â€

But everyone is too far, lanes too chaotic, fear too loud.

Utâ€™s eyes dart as his timer runs.

Rally starts toward himâ€”then Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· angles in, forcing Rally to retreat.

Rally mutters, â€œNice.â€
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· grins. â€œThanks.â€

Ut hits 30.

Gone.

Axlot tries to be cleverâ€”baiting Nightmare, juking, laughing once like itâ€™s still a game.

Nightmare tags him.

Axlot freezesâ€”and immediately tries to force a step anyway, panic overriding logic.

The second voice doesnâ€™t hesitate.

Axlot is eliminated on the spot.

WavyDragons swears under his breath. â€œDonâ€™t. Move.â€

KennBlueDragon gets tagged while helping space_fan over a slick lane.

He freezes with his hand still half-reached toward her, like a promise interrupted.

space_fan spins back, â€œNoâ€”noâ€”â€

Polaris limps toward him as fast as her own pain allows.

Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· cuts her off with a smile. â€œWrong direction.â€

kiwi tries to flankâ€”but Acoustyx mirrors him.

KennBlueDragonâ€™s eyes lock on space_fan.

KennBlueDragon: â€œDonâ€™t stop. Donâ€™t waste it.â€

space_fanâ€™s voice breaks. â€œI canâ€™tâ€”â€

KennBlueDragon hits 30 seconds.

Heâ€™s gone.

Polaris goes very still for a beat, then forces herself to move again.

Polaris, barely audible: â€œWeâ€™re not letting this eat us.â€

At 40 minutes, the horn blares again.

Another truce is offered.

This time, nobody speaks.

Nightmare finally says, â€œTruce.â€

Elv answers immediately. â€œTruce.â€

Five minutes of breathing. Five minutes of grief swallowed.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur whispers, â€œWeâ€™re down a lot.â€
Shroud replies, â€œWeâ€™re down the loud ones.â€

Lysrix looks at Polaris and kiwi. â€œYou twoâ€¦ youâ€™re watching corners like you see something.â€
Polaris lies smoothly. â€œJust counting exits.â€
kiwi adds, â€œJust learning angles.â€

Truce ends.

Revenant spends the last stretch playing heroâ€”unfreezing two people back-to-back, counting fast, burning his own safety.

Revenant shouts, â€œTHREEâ€”MOVE!â€
JIKOSU staggers free, gasping.
Lysrix gets tapped free seconds later by Elv.

Revenant turnsâ€”and lumallie is already there.

lumallie tags him.

Revenant freezes standing, still facing forward like he refuses to look defeated.

Elv tries to reach him but Nightmare forces Elv to dodge.

Polaris starts toward Revenantâ€”then hesitates, seeing the angle is death.

Revenant says calmly, â€œDonâ€™t.â€
Revenantâ€™s eyes flick to the clock. â€œLive.â€

No one reaches him.

30 seconds.

Revenant is eliminated.

The second voice hums, pleased: â€œEight.â€

The horn blares long and final.

â€œOne hour complete.â€

The arena lights soften.

Survivors stand trembling, sweaty, hollow-eyedâ€”counting who remains like itâ€™s a prayer they donâ€™t believe in.

Polaris finds kiwi again immediately. kiwi finds Polaris just as fast.

Neither of them speaks about the way one duck-camera seems to be facing them both.

Not yet.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 4 â€” THE DOME

The game ends, but the arena doesnâ€™t feel finished with them.

Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· stands with his hands on his knees, breathing hard, and when he looks up his face is tight with something close to regret.
lumallie wonâ€™t meet anyoneâ€™s eyes at allâ€”her jaw keeps workingâ€¦like sheâ€™s chewing guilt.
Acoustyx wipes his hands on his pants like he can scrub the rules off his skin.

Nightmare doesnâ€™t do any of that.

Nightmare looksâ€¦ satisfied.

No one really notices. Theyâ€™re too busy counting who didnâ€™t make it. Too busy swallowing names.

The second voice interrupts the grief like itâ€™s background noise.

â€œRest. Now.â€

Instantly, the lights drop.

The path-lights on the floor ignite againâ€”cold, guiding.

They follow without arguing. Not because they agree, but because theyâ€™ve learned what disobedience costs.

space_fan limps in silence, her brace tight, refusing help until her foot wobbles and she accepts it anyway.
Elv stays beside her, steady pace, not talking.
Rally keeps his eyes forward, shoulders tense, as if the path might change beneath him.
WavyDragons mutters, â€œI hate that we justâ€¦ do what it says.â€
CharliSpirit whispers, â€œI hate that Iâ€™m relieved to be told what to do.â€

They expect dorm doors.

They donâ€™t get dorm doors.

The path carries them into a massive glass dome.

And everyone stops.

Outside the dome is not darkness.

Outside the dome is waterâ€”an endless ocean pressed against the glass, full of slow-moving shadows and pale drifting shapes. Sea creatures glide past like this place is an aquarium the size of a world.

For a moment, grief loosens its grip.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur presses his palm to the glass. â€œNo wayâ€¦â€
He shifts, and a small duck sits tucked under his arm like a pet. â€œDeino, you seeing this?â€
Lysrix actually smiles for half a second. â€œOkayâ€¦ thatâ€™s insane.â€
Shroud tilts his head, quiet. â€œThey built an ocean around us.â€
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· exhales, almost awed despite himself. â€œThatâ€™sâ€¦ beautiful.â€
lumallie whispers, â€œDonâ€™t let it distract you. Thatâ€™s the point.â€
Acoustyx scans the seams of the dome. â€œStill a cage.â€
Nightmare just watches the water like itâ€™s entertainment. â€œYeah. Nice view.â€

Theyâ€™re wowing, breathing, almost forgettingâ€”

until kiwi and Polaris see it.

A rubber duck figure floats outside the dome, perfectly still in the ocean-dark. Not drifting like the others. Not bobbing.

Itâ€™s upright.

And somehowâ€¦ its beak is angled directly at them.

Polaris goes cold.
kiwiâ€™s stomach drops.

And then the flashbacks hitâ€”hard, wrong, vivid.

Day 1. Floodlights. The platform. The crowd.

In the memory, the duck figure was there the whole timeâ€”standing behind the lights, watching them.
In the memory, it was closer than it shouldâ€™ve been.
In the memory, it was looking at them exactly like this.

Polaris whispers without moving her lips, â€œThat wasnâ€™t there.â€
kiwi breathes, â€œI remember it.â€
Polarisâ€™ eyes flick to him. â€œSo do I.â€

They donâ€™t tell anyone. They choose silence like itâ€™s armor.

A table rises from the floor with a soft mechanical sighâ€”desserts laid out neatly, almost cheerful.

Duccarianâ€™s voice returns like nothing is wrong.

â€œFeast. Youâ€™ve earned sugar.â€

WavyDragons stares at the desserts like theyâ€™re a trap with frosting. â€œI hate that I want it.â€
Rally takes a piece anyway. â€œEat. We need energy.â€
space_fan lowers herself into a seat carefully. â€œIf itâ€™s poison, itâ€™s late.â€
Elv hands her a napkin without a word.
CharliSpirit takes a small bite and closes her eyes. â€œOkayâ€¦ okay, thatâ€™s good.â€
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur nudges Deino closer to the table like heâ€™s sharing the moment. â€œDonâ€™t judge me, Deino.â€
Lysrix laughs once, breathy and tired. â€œWeâ€™re bonding with ducks. Great.â€
Shroud watches Nightmare instead of the food. â€œYouâ€™re too calm.â€
Nightmare finally looks away from the dome. â€œIâ€™m fine.â€

When they finish, they feel it before it happensâ€”the familiar dim, the shift in air.

The dome lights fade.

The floor path-lights ignite again.

Bedtime.

No speeches. No games. Just the quiet machinery of control.

They walk back slower now, guiding the injured without needing to be told.

Elv keeps space_fan steady by the elbow.
Rally stays near JIKOSU, watching his shoulder like it might fail.
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· hangs back, face unreadable.
lumallie walks with her hands clenched, like sheâ€™s trying not to remember.
Acoustyx keeps scanning corners out of habit.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur carries Deino carefully.
CharliSpirit stays close to Lysrix.
Shroud takes the rear.

Polaris and kiwi walk side by side, and neither looks at the water again.

They reach the dorms.

They sleep.

Or at least, most of them do.

Because in the dark, kiwiâ€™s dreams return him to Day 1â€”floodlights, platform, and that upright duck watching from the glare.
And Polaris wakes with her heart pounding, certain she heard a squeak that didnâ€™t come from any speaker.

Neither of them says a word.

Not yet.
