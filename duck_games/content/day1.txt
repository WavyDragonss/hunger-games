[[DAY]]
DAY 1 - THE BEGINNING
Fog hangs over the pond like a low ceiling. The floating platform sits trapped in a ring of floodlights—bright enough to hurt your eyes, yet somehow still a closed space. The air feels staged. The water feels like it’s listening.

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian : “Good evening, contestants. Welcome to The Duck Pond. Tonight is orientation. No games. No exits. Behave.”

The speakers click off.

Silence… then a second voice slides in—lower, slower, and far too close.

“Thank you for arriving.”

A cold pressure settles in the light.

kiwi feels it first—like a chill under the ribs.
Snowlaris feels it right after—like something smiling behind her shoulder.

kiwi : “Snow… did you feel that?”
Snowlaris : “Yeah. That wasn’t part of the show.”

The second voice hums, amused.

space_fan : “Why do the ducks look like cameras?”
BLEUG! : “If this is a prank, it’s got a budget.”
Golden : “I hate stages. Stages mean scripts.”
Toad : “There’s no wind. The air’s… trapped.”
Godly_Aura : “Lights, water, sound system—someone planned every angle.”
Smart2004 : “Okay. Everyone stop talking over each other. We need a read on the room.”
CrystalWolf : “The room is the problem. It’s too perfect.”
Nightmare : “If something jumps out, I’m jumping back harder.”
Elv : “Breathe slow. Panic makes noise.”
Rally : “I don’t like ponds. Too much hiding space.”

The second voice whispers, pleased: “Good. You’re listening.”
A ripple rolls across the pond—no wind, no splash. Just a line of motion like a finger dragging through water.

WavyDragons : “This is insane. Who even builds a place like this?”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “Doesn’t matter. Built things can break.”
KennBlueDragon : “I almost fell off the edge. The platform tilted. It’s… moving.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur : “I’m naming the ducks. If we’re trapped, we’re at least doing it with morale.”
janhk. : “No seams. No weak boards. Whoever made this expected us to test it.”

Near the center, people bunch up under the harshest light like moths forced into order.

CharliSpirit : “So… is there a formal introduction? Or do we just stand here until something happens?”
Schwonkey : “Hello? Whoever’s on the speakers—what’s the objective?”
Bofa : “Don’t ask it questions like it’s human.”
Lysrix : “I don’t like the second voice. It sounds… happy.”
Revenant : “Pair up. Nobody stays alone. That’s how places like this pick you off.”
Akarimmu : “Count heads. If someone disappears, we notice instantly.”
Acoustyx : “Quiet. Listen between the words. That’s where it hides.”

The second voice returns, softer than before:

“Excellent instincts.”

The floodlights brighten a fraction—like the platform is leaning closer.
Shadows shift at the edge of the platform where the light fails to reach the water.

Ninnginni : “This is a reality show for monsters. Lovely.”
Loyal2Schwalb : “Rule one: never take anything offered by a duck.”
JIKOSU : “I can hop the rail—” (He grabs it.) “No. It’s hot. Why is it hot?”
lumallie : “Because it wants you to stay. That’s the only rule that matters.”
NinjaFlout : “Then we make our own rules. We watch. We wait. We strike when it slips.”
Ut : “I’m going to check the far side.” (He steps into a shadow—then reappears two meters away.) “Okay. The shadows are… wrong.”
Axlot : “I found a hatch—fake. Painted on. Someone thinks that’s funny.”
Shroud : “We’re being measured. Every word, every flinch.”

The second voice sighs, satisfied.

“Orientation is simple: learn each other. Learn the platform. Learn fear.”

A line of white doors rises from the floor—clean, silent, evenly spaced. Not cages. Not rooms. Something in-between.

Toad : “Those weren’t there five minutes ago.”
Smart2004 : “Everyone pick a door near someone you trust. No wandering.”
Snowlaris : “Kiwi. Stay close.”
kiwi : “I’m not leaving your side.”

One by one, the doors open into bright, empty compartments—sterile and waiting.

The floodlights dim just enough to remind everyone how dark the pond really is.

The second voice gives a final whisper, almost gentle:

“Sleep. Tomorrow, you’ll understand why you were chosen.”

The doors slide shut.

And Day 1 ends with the pond perfectly still—like it’s holding a secret under the platform.
Night falls like a switch being flipped.

A hidden hatchline opens along the platform’s edge, and the floor guides them off—not with doors, but with a single trail of lights embedded into the ground, pale and cold, like runway markers.

Beyond that line: total darkness.

Behind them: a wall of crackling light slides forward every few seconds—an electric, solid curtain that hums with pressure.

They try the sides. Nothing. Just black.

They try to stop. The wall inches closer.

JIKOSU reaches back on impulse—just to test it.

A tiny tsssk.

The tip of his finger turns to ash and falls away like burned paper.

He yanks his hand back, choking on his own breath.

The whole group breaks at once—scrambling, shouting, running—only to realize the same truth over and over:

There is no exit behind them.

There is no exit to the sides.

There is only the line of ground-lights… and the unknown ahead.

So they move.

Minutes become a blur. The hall never ends—just darkness, lights, and the constant closing whisper of electricity.
Then, finally, the lights widen into a circle.

A set of doors rises out of nothing—matte white, featureless, too clean for a place this wrong.

Speakers hidden somewhere in the ceiling crackle alive.

That second voice returns—low, calm, and far too close.

“Welcome to the dormitory corridor.”

The lights brighten just enough to show what they’re standing in: a long, windowless hall wrapped around the pond like a collar, suspended over black water. Doors line both sides, identical, numbered in faint gray.

“The lights on the ground are your path. Step off them, and you will learn why you should not.”

The electric wall pauses at the far end of the hallway, still humming—waiting.

“This is not a prison,” the voice says, almost amused. “It is a preparation chamber. You will sleep. You will rest. You will listen.”

A soft click—every door unlocks at once.

“Choose a room. Close it. Do not open it again until morning.”

The speakers go dead.

And only then do they all finally speak.

space_fan : “Okay—nope. I hate how it knows what we’ll do before we do it.”
BLEUG! : “That wall is a warning. Next time it won’t be a fingertip.”
Golden : “Doors with no handles. Great. Love that for us.”
Toad : “Stay on the lights. No hero moves. We survive by being boring.”
Godly_Aura : “The corridor is a test. It’s measuring fear response and compliance.”
Smart2004 : “Pair up. Rooms near each other. If someone goes quiet, we notice.”
Snowlaris : “Kiwi—same door block. Right now.”
CrystalWolf : “I want to believe it’s just theatrics. But my stomach doesn’t.”

Nightmare : “If it wants rules, fine. I’ll follow rules… until I’m strong enough to break them.”
Elv : “We keep calm. We keep structure. Panic is what it’s fishing for.”
Rally : “I’m not sleeping with my back to a wall that moves.”
WavyDragons : “So we’re really doing this… rooms and curfew and psycho speakers.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “It bleeds, it loses. Whatever it is—eventually.”
KennBlueDragon : “My hands are shaking. I hate that they’re shaking.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur : “I’m taking a duck with me. If I’m doomed, I’m not doomed alone.”
janhk. : “Doors unlock together. That means it controls them together. Remember that.”

CharliSpirit : “I’m officially requesting a normal night. Just once.”
Schwonkey : “We need a headcount every hour. This place is built for disappearances.”
Bofa : “No windows. No clocks. It’s trying to remove time from us.”
Lysrix : “I don’t like the way it said ‘learn.’ Like we’re the lesson.”
Revenant : “Alright—rooms close together. No wandering. We make it to morning.”
Akarimmu : “If anyone’s door opens in the night—shout. Don’t investigate alone.”
Acoustyx : “It wants us isolated. So we do the opposite.”

Ninnginni : “A corridor with rules and a smiling voice. Charming. Absolutely charming.”
Loyal2Schwalb : “If the floor lights change color, we run. I don’t care where.”
kiwi : “I knew it was wrong. I just didn’t know it was this wrong.”
JIKOSU : “My finger… I— I’m not touching anything ever again.”
lumallie : “It’s not trying to kill us tonight. It’s trying to train us.”
NinjaFlout : “Then we train back. Quietly. Patiently.”
Ut : “I walked ten minutes and didn’t pass a single turn. The hallway loops.”
Axlot : “If it wants us in rooms… I’m sleeping with something heavy in my hand.”
Shroud : “This isn’t a dorm. It’s a funnel. Tomorrow is the blade.”
