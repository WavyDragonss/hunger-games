[[DAY]]
DAY 9 — THE COLOSSEUM

Duck quacks wake them.

At first it’s almost stupid—clean little samples, spaced like a toy alarm. Then the gaps shrink. The pitch climbs. The quacks start stacking on top of each other until it’s not “sound” anymore, it’s pressure—an endless rise that never reaches the top.

Rally sits up with a slow, exhausted inhale.
JIKOSU doesn’t even open his eyes at first—just flinches like his bones are listening.
kiwi rubs his face hard, as if he can wipe the last three days off his skin.
Polaris stares at the ceiling, already bracing for the next rule.

When the dorm doors unlock, the lights outside are different.

Warm.

Amber.

Curated.

Like the place is trying to pretend it’s a home instead of a cage.

A table rises from the floor—real breakfast, actually hot, actually good. Next to it, four sets of clothes in sealed, clear packets.

Not generic “fresh clothes.”

Their clothes.

Their favorite fit.

The exact cut. The exact comfort. The exact version of themselves they wore back when the world was normal and choice still meant something.

None of them even has the energy to ask how.

They just change.

They just eat.

They just accept it—because hunger is louder than suspicion, and the pond is very good at making surrender look like kindness.

A soft chime rings through the speakers.

Duccarian’s voice arrives without the usual bite—quiet, almost gentle.

“Congratulations,” he says. “The final four.”

A pause, like he’s savoring the shape of it.

“You showed signs of kindness. Teamwork. Strength. Steadiness. He repeats himself.”

The words land wrong. Not because they’re untrue, but because they’re being used like labels on jars.

He isn’t praising them.

He’s cataloguing them.

The floor-lights ignite in a neat line. No siren. No panic-hum of the electric wall. Just a path that says: this way, because there is no other way.

They follow it.

The hallway is longer than they remember, or maybe they’re just more tired. Their footsteps sound too loud, like the building is listening for weakness.

Then the corridor opens.

And the arena is waiting.

A colosseum—tiered, elliptical, designed so that no matter where you stand, you feel watched from every angle. The floor looks like pale sand, but it isn’t sand. It’s something engineered to swallow sound and reflect light back up into your face.

Above them, the tiers fill with holograms.

Their dead friends.

Smiling. Cheering. Clapping.

It is wrong in the way a dream is wrong: the faces are perfect, but the timing is off. The applause loops too cleanly. A laugh repeats in the same cadence twice.

A few holograms glitch for a breath—half a second of a scream spliced into a cheer—then snap back into “happy,” as if the system is forcing the dead to celebrate the living.

Polaris’s throat tightens.
kiwi feels his stomach drop like he just stepped onto a bad tile.
JIKOSU whispers, barely audible: “That’s not them.”
Rally doesn’t answer. He’s staring at the center of the arena like he already knows what it’s going to cost.

A projector beam draws letters in the air:

JIKOSU vs POLARIS
RALLY vs KIWI

A mechanical click echoes overhead.

And the rules arrive—short, final, merciless.

[[RULES]]
RULES 

NO PEACE

NO SURRENDER

NO TEAMING

ONLY 1 LEAVES ALIVE

BREAKING THE RULES MEANS DEATH

No stalling. No “waiting it out.” The arena will interpret inaction as surrender.

If you attempt to protect your opponent, you have formed a team.

If you refuse to fight, you have broken the rules.

Reach the end alive.

[[NARRATIVE]]
The last line—Reach the end alive—hangs in the air like a joke told by someone holding a blade.

A tone sounds. Not a horn. Not a siren.

A referee.

The matches begin.

Rally looks at kiwi.

Not as an enemy.

As a person.

And kiwi sees it—the same choice Rally has been carrying since the first day the pond taught them to stop being “people” and start being “survivors.”

Rally sets his weapon down.

The holograms cheer louder, as if volume can shame him into violence.

Rally lifts his hands—palms open, empty, honest.

“I’m not doing it,” he says, voice echoing up into the tiers. “Not like this.”

For a second, it feels like the arena doesn’t understand.

Then the pond corrects him.

A single sharp tone snaps through the colosseum—clean and emotionless.

Rally’s body locks, then collapses as if the floor stole his strings. No spectacle. No struggle. Just a brutal, clinical consequence.

Breaking the rules means death.

kiwi doesn’t feel saved.

He feels advanced.

Selected.

Forced forward by somebody else’s refusal to become a monster.

And the worst part is: Rally’s choice doesn’t free him from the game.

It only makes him the one who has to keep living inside it.

Across the arena, Polaris and JIKOSU are already moving.

JIKOSU is injured. He’s been injured for days—never enough time for healing, never enough time for rest. He tries to lift his arms into guard and his shoulder lags, half a beat behind his will.

Half a beat is everything here.

Polaris closes the distance with a steadiness that scares her. Not because she wants to win—because the rules don’t allow her to stop.

JIKOSU tries to pivot away, tries to buy time, tries to look for a path that doesn’t end with one of them gone.

The arena doesn’t reward searching.

The holograms chant like a crowd at a sport that never asked permission.

Polaris disarms him with an ugly efficiency—hands moving before thought can catch up. JIKOSU staggers back into the brightest center of the floor, the exact place the system wants a death to happen.

He drops to one knee—not surrender, not pleading. Just his body giving out.

Polaris hesitates.

Just long enough to prove she’s still human.

A warning tick clicks once above them—soft, polite, terrible.

Do it.

So she does.

JIKOSU collapses, eyes open, breath gone, the arena satisfied with its clean outcome.

Polaris steps back like she’s leaving her own skin behind.

Two down.

Two left.

The colosseum lights intensify, bleaching the world into sharp edges.

And then—without a speaker crackle, without a hallway entrance—

Trxty is simply there.

Between kiwi and Polaris.

Mask on.

Still as a statue placed for worship.

The holograms dim as if the dead are being told to hush.

Trxty raises one hand.

Slowly removes the mask.

The face underneath isn’t horror. It’s real injury that healed wrong—scarred, pulled, disfigured in a way that makes the past feel like it’s sitting in the room with them.

Polaris’s breath catches like she’s been hit again.

kiwi feels that old nausea, that remembered guilt, that night they don’t talk about because words make it too real.

Trxty’s voice is the second voice—now coming from a throat instead of a speaker.

“Hello,” he says, soft as a greeting in a home. “Old friends.”

Polaris’s eyes flood. “We thought you were—”
Trxty tilts his head. “Dead?”

A small laugh. No warmth.

“I wasn’t dead,” he says. “I was discarded.”

The floor-lights at the arena’s edge glow brighter, as if the building itself leans in to listen.

Trxty looks at kiwi, then Polaris, like he’s weighing which one of them deserves to suffer first.

“You don’t get to leave this time,” he says. “Not with the lie intact.”

A shape appears near the edge of their vision—faint, hovering, almost nothing.

A rubber duck.

The same silhouette that stalked their fear.

It drifts in the air as if the world forgot gravity.

kiwi flinches.
Polaris’s hands shake.

Trxty watches their reactions with quiet satisfaction—because the duck was never meant for anyone else.

It was always for them.

“Fight,” Trxty says. “Until death.”

He steps backward, letting the arena reclaim them.

The referee tone returns.

kiwi and Polaris face each other.

They don’t want to.

But the rules have removed every human exit. Peace is a violation. Surrender is a violation. Teaming is a violation. Standing still is a violation.

So they move.

At first it’s clumsy—two exhausted people circling like they’re trying to find a way out of the floor itself. Polaris keeps her guard up, jaw clenched, eyes bright with rage she doesn’t even know who it’s for anymore.

kiwi backs away, trying to think like a puzzle: there has to be a pattern, a loophole, a secret lane that doesn’t kill you.

Then the duck quacks once.

Not cute.

A cue.

Polaris’s posture falters for a fraction—the memory of being hit by mist, the phantom impact, the way nobody else noticed.

kiwi’s eyes dart toward the sound.

A tiny shift of balance.

A wrong step.

His foot skids on the arena floor—slicker than it should be—and he feels something bite his side.

A ceramic shard.

Clean, razor-thin, like a puzzle piece broken on purpose.

The pain arrives a heartbeat later, hot and sharp, and kiwi’s hand comes away wet when he presses his palm to the wound.

Not a spray. Not a gore-show.

Just a quiet, creeping certainty.

The arena has added a timer inside his body.

Polaris sees the blood darkening his shirt.

Her face collapses for a second—human again.

“kiwi—”
The warning tick clicks overhead.

Do not stop.

Do not hesitate.

Do not become gentle.

So she moves again, hardening her eyes because softness will kill them both.

kiwi’s world narrows. Sound becomes distant. The holograms clap, clap, clap like metronomes.

He tries to stay upright. Tries to keep his legs under him. Tries to keep his mind from drifting into that foggy place where you stop caring whether you live.

Polaris lunges.

kiwi pivots out of instinct, and the movement tears the wound wider—pain flaring like fire under his ribs. His vision sparks at the edges.

He grabs Polaris’s wrist—not as an attack, but as a desperate anchor.

They crash to the floor.

For a moment they’re tangled in the center of the arena, breathing the same breath, eyes inches apart, both looking like they’re about to break.

Polaris whispers, voice shredded: “I don’t want—”
kiwi chokes on the words, because speaking feels like spending blood. “Then don’t… make me…”

The duck quacks again.

And the arena’s patience ends.

A pressure slams into Polaris’s abdomen—an invisible punch that folds her for a breath. Her gasp is sharp, involuntary.

kiwi reacts on pure survival.

He moves before he can think.

He finishes it.

Not with triumph.

With the blank reflex the pond has been training into them since Day 1.

Polaris goes still.

The holograms erupt—cheers, applause, smiles forced into their dead mouths.

kiwi staggers back, one hand pressed to his side.

He’s standing.

He’s alone.

He’s the “winner” in the center of a colosseum that wanted exactly this image: one survivor upright, one survivor gone, and the survivor too hollow to celebrate.

The projector writes a single word in the air:

VICTORY

The floor-lights along one wall ignite into an exit path.

A door unlocks with a clean, optimistic chime—like a game show prize reveal.

kiwi takes a step toward it.

His knees wobble.

He takes another step.

The warmth in his side spreads, heavy and sick, turning his shirt darker. His heartbeat roars in his ears like ocean.

He makes it halfway.

Then the world tilts.

He hits the floor on his side, breath ragged, fingers still pressing hard as if he can hold life in with his palm.

The cheering holograms keep clapping.

Nobody comes.

Because the rules were never “one leaves alive.”

The rules were “one leaves last.”

Trxty steps closer, mask in hand, face unreadable.

He looks down at kiwi, and for the first time he seems… calm.

Satisfied.

Not because he got “revenge.”

Because he got proof.

Proof that the pond could take kindness and teamwork and still grind it into a single ending: isolation.

kiwi tries to speak. It comes out as air and a broken sound.

Trxty crouches just enough to be heard over the applause.

“You felt watched,” he murmurs. “Good.”

Then Duccarian speaks again—voice from the speakers, warm as ever, like he’s narrating a documentary about insects.

“No night tonight,” Duccarian says. “No recovery sequence. No further rounds.”

The lights soften—almost tender, like the arena is pretending to respect what it just did.

Duccarian continues, tone measured, controlled.

“You still think this was only punishment.”

A pause.

“This was a demonstration.”

The holograms flicker—one frame of screams, then back to cheers.

Duccarian’s voice lowers, almost conversational.

“People say they want heroes. They say they want the brave. They say they want the good.”

“But when survival becomes the rule… goodness becomes a liability.”

He lets that sit, like a thesis.

“I built the Duck Pond to answer a question the world above refuses to ask honestly.”

“What happens to morality when the environment makes it expensive?”

Another pause—then quieter:

“And what happens to guilt when it is given a face.”

Trxty looks up toward the speakers, satisfied in a way that feels final.

Duccarian finishes, soft as a closing lullaby:

“You didn’t fail because you were weak.”

“You failed because you were human.”

kiwi’s eyes glaze, unfocused. The applause becomes distant, like it’s happening at the bottom of a deep pond.

Trxty stands.

He doesn’t touch the body.

He doesn’t need to.

He watches until kiwi’s breathing slows, then stops—blood loss finally claiming what the arena started.

Only then does Trxty slip the mask back on, as if returning to a role.

He faces the tiers of cheering dead.

And for the first time, he sounds content.

“Thank you,” he says. “That was perfect.”

The holograms cut out.

The projector dies.

The colosseum lights go dark in a single clean blink—

like a system closing a file.

[[LOG]]
DEATH LOG

Rally — Eliminated (refused to fight; broke NO SURRENDER / NO PEACE)

JIKOSU — Eliminated (lost the match)

Polaris — Eliminated (lost the match)

kiwi — Died (blood loss after final duel)

[[NARRATIVE]]
There is no night.

No siren.

No guiding path.

No dorm doors unlocking again.

Just a silent arena with nobody left to entertain—

and a single rubber duck sitting at the edge of the floor-lights, facing the place where the last survivor fell.

Still.

Watching.

As if the pond, finally satisfied, can afford to be quiet.
