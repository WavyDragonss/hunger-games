[[DAY]]
DAY 7 — RUBBER ROOMS (THE REAL BLOODBATH)

[[AUTHOR NOTE]]
Alive at start of Day 7:
Nightmare, Elv, Vanarknees 🇦🇷, lumallie, Rally, space_fan, JIKOSU, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, kiwi, Polaris

[[NARRATIVE]]
They wake up to violence.

Not an alarm—an earthquake.

The whole structure bucks under them. Walls rattle. The floor kicks like something huge moved underneath the pond.

Nightmare is on his feet instantly.
Elv grabs the bedframe to steady himself. “What is that?”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 spits, “They’re shaking us loose.”
lumallie’s eyes are wide but empty. “They want us dizzy.”
Rally’s voice is hoarse. “Everybody outside. Now.”
space_fan limps fast despite the pain. “No breakfast… and this?”
JIKOSU winces, shoulder stabbing. “Great.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur clutches the wall. “Deino’s cousin didn’t sign up for earthquakes.”
CharliSpirit breathes, “This is the bloodbath day… isn’t it.”
Shroud is already gone—there is no Shroud anymore. The absence feels like a bruise.

They spill into the hall, groggy, confused, staring at each other like they all woke up in someone else’s nightmare.

Then Duccarian’s voice comes onto the speakers—calm, upbeat, like he’s hosting a kids’ show.

“Hurry through the hall.”

No explanation. No comfort. Just an order wrapped in cheer.

But Polaris and kiwi can’t focus.

The rubber duck is back.

Not in a corner this time.

In the open.

Creepier. Taller. Wrong in the way it holds itself.

And now it moves.

kiwi sees it first.

It’s far—then closer—then closer again.

He blinks and it’s half the distance.

Polaris still sees it where it started, floating near the wall seam like a stain that won’t scrub out.

kiwi rubs his eyes hard.

The duck is right in front of him.

He reaches to grab it—

His hands cut through mist.

Nothing.

The duck doesn’t react like an object.

It reacts like intent.

Polaris stays locked on her version of it, heart pounding, thinking: why us.

Then the answer hits like a memory snapping into place.

The voice. The phrasing. The “old friends.”

Trxty.

Their old friend.

The one they thought they lost—years ago—after a night they never speak about.

Polaris starts crying before she can stop herself.

Her eyes flick away for one second.

The duck—made of mist—hits her in the stomach like a battering ram.

Polaris folds to the ground, choking on air.

kiwi turns toward her—

And his duck slams into him the same way.

He drops beside her, clutching his abdomen, gasping, confused by pain that shouldn’t exist.

Nobody else notices.

They’re too focused on Duccarian’s voice repeating the same bright command.

“Hurry through the hall.”

And they do.

They move.

They leave Polaris and kiwi behind like the corridor itself is pushing them forward.

They reach the end.

A digital screen flickers.

Rally reads it out loud, voice turning cold.

“ERROR: Cannot start, tributes are missing.”

Everyone freezes.

Elv’s eyes widen. “Polaris. kiwi.”
CharliSpirit spins. “Where are they?”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur swallows hard. “No. No no no.”

They go back.

Polaris and kiwi are still on the floor, shaking, holding their stomachs like they were punched by something invisible.

Polaris forces words out. “Go… I’m fine—”
Rally crouches. “You’re not fine. Up.”
Elv helps lift Polaris. “Slow. Breathe.”
JIKOSU takes kiwi’s arm. “Lean.”
space_fan limps closer, furious and scared. “What happened?”
kiwi can barely speak. “Duck.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 mutters, “What duck?”
lumallie’s face tightens. “Don’t start that again.”
Nightmare watches Polaris and kiwi like they’re a clue.

They stagger forward together—carrying each other.

When they reach the screen, it makes a confirmation sound.

The door unlocks.

A bright hallway opens into a room with individual entries—each marked with a name tag.

Duccarian’s voice returns.

“Enter.”

They obey.

Quietly, they offer each other the only kindness they have left—words.

Elv to Rally: “Be smart.”
CharliSpirit to space_fan: “If you hear me… don’t listen.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur to JIKOSU: “If you live, tell Deino I tried.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 to lumallie: “If you get out first… don’t forget me.”
lumallie doesn’t answer—just nods once, jaw clenched.
Nightmare smirks. “Three hours is plenty.”
Rally doesn’t look at him. “Nothing is plenty in this place.”
Polaris and kiwi don’t speak at all. They only hold their stomachs and try not to look for mist.

The doors seal one by one.

Each tribute is alone.

Each tribute faces the rules alone.

[[RULES]]
RULES — RUBBER ROOMS

The rooms are sealed from any sound and light.

Only a dim light is provided.

Many rubber ducks will keep you company.

Complete a 5000-piece ceramic puzzle.

You will be haunted by the screams of your lost friends during their deaths through speakers and holograms.

Finish the puzzle within 3 hours.

DO NOT DAMAGE THE CERAMIC PIECES.

The final puzzle must resemble a duck floating on a pond! :D

[[NARRATIVE]]
The dim lights hum on.

Each room is the same in spirit, different in cruelty.

Rubber ducks everywhere—on shelves, on the floor, in corners, staring. Too many. Too close.

A long table. A mountain of ceramic puzzle pieces. Cold. Smooth. Sharp enough to cut.

Then the speakers come alive.

Screams.

Not random screams.

Familiar ones.

Golden’s last breath.
Toad’s steam-choked panic.
Schwonkey drowning.
Godly_Aura slipping under.

Holograms flicker, acting out deaths like theatre.

CharliSpirit drops to her knees. “No… please…”
space_fan whispers, shaking, “Stop. Stop—”
Elv forces himself upright. “Hands. Move your hands.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur squeezes his eyes shut. “I’m not watching.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 snarls, “I’m not listening either.”
lumallie starts sorting pieces with mechanical speed, trying to outwork trauma.
Nightmare laughs once—quietly. “Cute.”

Rally becomes a machine: edge pieces first, frame built fast, ignoring the holograms like they’re static.
JIKOSU breathes through pain and works carefully, hands steady by sheer stubbornness.
kiwi’s hands tremble constantly—rubber ducks everywhere, staring—he keeps thinking he sees mist moving in the corner of his eye.
Polaris is on the edge of breaking from the first minute—every duck looks like it—every shadow feels like Trxty’s voice wearing a mask.

The timer burns.

One hour.

Two.

The room grows louder, not quieter.

Nightmare tries to brute-force speed.

He presses too hard.

A ceramic piece cracks in his hand—sharp, audible.

The room goes silent for half a heartbeat.

Then the speaker chirps, cheerful:

“RULE VIOLATION.”

A bright flash.

Nightmare doesn’t even get a scream out.

He’s dropped where he stands—gone in a blink—like the room swallowed him.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 goes faster, furious now—hands shaking with anger.
A piece slips. Chips against the table. A tiny fracture.

“RULE VIOLATION.”

He disappears mid-breath.

lumallie hears the holograms and finally snaps—slamming his palm down once, hard, trying to drown out the noise.

Ceramic splinters.

“RULE VIOLATION.”

Gone.

space_fan’s ankle screams every time she shifts position. Her hands shake. A piece falls from her grip.

Crack.

Her eyes go wide.

“RULE VIOLATION.”

Gone.

CharliSpirit sobs and tries to keep working anyway—tears blurring the pieces, fingers slipping, breath breaking.

A piece scrapes off the table and chips.

“RULE VIOLATION.”

Gone.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur tries to laugh through it, tries to pretend it’s just a puzzle, tries to think of Deino—

But the screams spike, the holograms play too close, his hands jerk—

A piece fractures.

“RULE VIOLATION.”

Gone.

The rooms keep humming.

The timer keeps running.

Only four sets of hands remain moving.

Rally.
JIKOSU.
kiwi.
Polaris.

At 2 hours and 57 minutes, Rally fits the last cluster with a shaking exhale.

At 2 hours and 58, JIKOSU locks a corner piece in and flinches like he expects punishment.

At 2 hours and 59, kiwi forces his last piece down gently, whispering, “Please… please…” like the puzzle can hear him.

Polaris stares at her final piece for too long—rubber ducks surrounding her, screaming holograms behind her, mist in her memory—

Then she places it.

The image resolves:

A duck floating on a pond.

A chime plays.

“SUCCESS.”

Their doors unlock.

The four step out into the corridor at the same time—pale, shaking, eyes too wide, mouths too dry.

The timer hits 3 hours.

The other doors stay sealed.

No screams now.

Just silence that means final.

The four stand there for a moment, listening for any human sound.

Nothing.

An alarm sounds.

A familiar voice returns—Trxty’s voice in the masked man’s tone.

“Follow the lighted path to eat.”

Rally steps forward. “Wait—we need—”
He stops.

They all understand at once.

Time is up.

No one is coming out.

Polaris swallows hard. kiwi stares at the floor.
JIKOSU whispers, “They’re gone.”
Rally’s voice breaks. “Yeah.”

They follow the path.

The meal waiting for them is the best food they’ve ever tasted—warm, rich, perfect, cruelly perfect.

They dive in like starving animals.

For a few minutes, they almost forget the cost.

Almost.

Then the lights dim.

Night already.

They’re prompted to go to the dorms.

Rally helps guide them through the familiar hall—one hand steadying kiwi, the other watching Polaris like she might collapse.

Polaris whispers, “It’s too many ducks.”
kiwi answers, barely audible, “I can’t unsee it.”

In the dorms, they each retreat to their rooms.

A shared sigh.

Tomorrow might end it, they think.

JIKOSU looks at Rally and holds his gaze.
Rally nods once.

No words needed.

No harm.

Not between them.

They try to sleep.

But after the rubber rooms—

after the screams—

after the ducks—

sleep feels impossible.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 7 — AFTER THE RUBBER ROOMS

An alarm signals them to move.

Not because there’s a new game.

Because the pond wants them in place.

They return to the dorms like ghosts learning a route.

No one can sleep after what they did—after what they watched—after what they heard.

Rally sits on his bed, staring at nothing. “It won’t get easier.”
JIKOSU answers quietly, “So we either do something… or we die.”

Polaris lies down and immediately sits back up, breathing too fast, eyes locked on the darkest corner.
kiwi does the same across the room, palms pressed to his abdomen like he’s still bracing for a hit from mist.

They’re terrified the duck will come back in the dark.

They’re terrified it won’t—because that would mean something worse has replaced it.

Rally and JIKOSU speak once more, barely above a whisper.

Rally: “No matter what happens… we don’t turn on each other.”
JIKOSU: “Agreed.”

They try closing their eyes.

They fail.

The pond has taught them a final lesson:

Even when the room is silent—

the screaming can continue inside your head.
