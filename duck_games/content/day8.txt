[[DAY]]
DAY 8 — THE TOUR

[[AUTHOR NOTE]]
Alive at start of Day 8:
Rally, JIKOSU, kiwi, Polaris

[[NARRATIVE]]
A calm tune wakes them.

Not an alarm.

Not static.

A soft melody—almost comforting.

They barely stir at first.

Then the pitch rises.

Higher.

Higher.

Sharper.

Until it drills into their skulls and forces their eyes open.

The lights are different today.

Warmer.

Friendlier.

Like the pond is pretending it never hurt anyone.

Rally sits up slowly, blinking. “I don’t like this.”  
JIKOSU rubs his face. “I hate when it gets polite.”  
kiwi scans the corners immediately.  
Polaris does the same, stomach tight.  
Neither of them sees a duck. Neither of them hears mist.  
That somehow feels worse.

Duccarian’s voice comes softly through the speakers.

“Congratulations.”

A pause.

“The four last tributes.”

“You showed signs of kindness, teamwork, strength, and steadiness in your time here.”

Polaris whispers, “Strength?”  
kiwi answers, “He means endurance.”  
Rally mutters, “He means entertainment value.”  
JIKOSU exhales. “So… what now?”

Duccarian continues, gentle as a bedtime story.

“Today you will eat well.”

A table rises from the floor—overflowing with warm food. Real food. The kind that smells like home and makes your mouth water even when you don’t trust it.

Bread. Meat. Fruit. Hot dishes. Desserts.

JIKOSU’s eyes widen despite himself. “No way.”  
Rally sits down carefully like the chair might bite. “Eat. Fast. While it’s real.”  
Polaris stares at the steam. “This is the nicest trap yet.”  
kiwi still scans the room. “Where’s Trxty.”

No answer comes.

No duck appears.

They lower their guard by a fraction.

They feast.

They eat like starving people, because they are.

For the first time in days, nobody is shaking from hunger—only from nerves.

After the first rush of eating, Rally speaks again, quieter. “Something got into him.”  
JIKOSU shakes his head. “No. Something got *planned*.”  
Polaris swallows. “If he’s kind, it’s because it makes tomorrow worse.”  
kiwi nods. “Or because he wants us calm when it happens.”

Duccarian speaks again.

“After you are done eating, press the button next to your place.”

“All buttons must be pressed before two hours pass.”

A clock descends from the ceiling.

**2:00:00**

It begins counting down.

They all stare at it like it’s a weapon.

Rally points at the buttons—one beside each seat. “We don’t press early. We don’t press late.”  
JIKOSU nods. “We finish eating first. Then we do it together.”  
Polaris glances at kiwi. “If something appears, we don’t split.”  
kiwi answers, “We never split.”

Time passes strangely when you’re waiting for betrayal.

They keep eating anyway.

Not because they’re relaxed.

Because it’s the only good thing left.

At **0:15:00** remaining, Rally stands.

“Enough.”

He presses his button.

JIKOSU presses his immediately after.

Polaris hesitates half a second—watching corners—then presses.

kiwi presses last.

The clock hits **0:14:32**.

The lights flicker.

The air changes.

And the masked man appears.

Trxty.

Standing in the room like he was always part of it.

All four tense at once.

Rally steps forward. “What is this.”  
JIKOSU’s hands curl. “Where’s the duck.”  
Polaris feels her stomach ache just remembering mist.  
kiwi stares through the mask, trying to see a face that isn’t there.

Trxty speaks to all of them at once.

Not shouting.

Not laughing.

Almost… proud.

“Follow me.”

They hesitate.

Then the floor-lights ignite.

The path is familiar.

The command is unavoidable.

They follow.

[[NARRATIVE]]
Trxty leads them through every room they’ve survived.

The dorm hall—where sirens trained them like animals.

The Feast hall—where “comfort” was used like a leash.

The elevator corridor—where rules were spoken into their bones.

The glass dome—a silent ocean outside, sea creatures drifting like ghosts.

The maze entrance—where bright suits turned friends into hunters.

The rubber-room corridor—where doors stayed sealed forever.

Trxty walks like a tour guide.

Like this is a museum of pain.

He gestures sometimes—small movements, theatrical.

“Here,” he says softly, “is where you learned obedience.”

“Here,” as they pass the dome, “is where you learned hope can be controlled.”

“Here,” at the maze threshold, “is where you learned rules can make monsters out of kind people.”

Rally’s jaw is clenched so hard it trembles.  
JIKOSU keeps breathing shallow, like the air is sharp.  
Polaris’ eyes flick to every corner, expecting mist.  
kiwi’s hands stay half-raised, like he could catch something invisible.

They pass the rubber-room doors.

They are shut.

Silent.

No sound escapes.

Trxty’s voice is gentle there.

“Here,” he says, “is where your will to live became stronger than your will to break.”

Polaris whispers, “Why us.”  
Trxty turns his mask slightly toward her.

“You already know why.”

kiwi’s stomach turns. “Tomorrow?”  
Trxty pauses, as if savoring the moment.

Then he speaks the line that sticks to their bones.

“Tomorrow is the last day. The big day.”

He says it like it’s a gift.

Then he disappears before any of them can stop him.

The lights return to normal.

The path returns them to the dorms.

The rest of the day is quiet.

Not peaceful.

Quiet like a room holding its breath.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 8 — BEFORE THE LAST DAY

They try to sleep harder than they ever have.

Because tomorrow is coming whether they rest or not.

Rally sits on the edge of the bed for a long time. “We promised. No turning.”  
JIKOSU nods slowly. “We don’t fight each other. We fight the game.”  
Polaris whispers, “If the duck comes back…”  
kiwi answers immediately, “We stay together.”

They lie down.

They close their eyes.

They pray—some to gods, some to luck, some to nothing at all.

And in the dark, Trxty’s words echo until they feel carved into the walls:

“Tomorrow is the last day. The big day.”

Sleep comes in fragments.

And every fragment tastes like fear.
