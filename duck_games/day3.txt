[[DAY]]
DAY 3 - THE DUCK TILES

A static SCREEE rips through the dorms. Everyone bolts upright.

The second voice slides in, calm and cruel: “Eating time.”

The doors unlock. The hall is darker than usual. The guiding floor-lights lead them to the table.

And this time… it’s the opposite of comfort.

Perfectly edible. Perfectly warm. Every plate is their most hated food.

Lysrix stares like it’s a prank. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
space_fan gags and covers her mouth. “No. No way.”
Nightmare pokes it once. “This is disrespectful.”
lumallie doesn’t touch his fork. “It wants us miserable.”
kiwi mutters, “They know. They know.”

A few hands drift toward swapping plates.

The second voice snaps in instantly: “Switching food is forbidden. Vomiting is forbidden.”
A pause. Then softer: “Eat. Or starve.”

No one argues. Not out loud.

They force bites. They chew like punishment. They swallow like it’s a rule.

KennBlueDragon grimaces, “This is… personal.”
Rally wipes his mouth, “They’re testing obedience.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 growls, “They’re testing how fast we break.”

The “break” ends early because nobody can really eat.

They sit anyway. Talking low.

Smart2004 whispers, “Next game is soon. They’re weakening us.”
Snowlaris glances at kiwi. “That second voice… it’s getting bolder.”
CharliSpirit breathes, “I miss normal fear.”
WavyDragons mutters, “I’d rather fight than do this.”

Then silence. An hour of it.

The door opens again.

All lights die—except the guiding floor-lights.

And from behind the wall… that terrifying electric hum returns.
They step onto the line without being told. Calmer now. Not braver—just trained.

Water slaps below somewhere unseen. The hum follows like a leash.

A huge room opens ahead.

A platform—4 tiles wide, 45 long—mosaic patterned with rubber-looking tiles and solid ones.
On both sides: dark water.
At the far end: a “safe” platform.

Along the edges sit countless rubber ducks, each with a water-gun-like nozzle in its mouth, aimed at the tiles.

Nobody knows what it means.

Everyone talks anyway—because silence feels like consent.

Nightmare “This is a bridge. A rigged one.”
Elv “Pattern game. Memory or sacrifice.”
WavyDragons “Those ducks are weapons. I can feel it.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 “We sprint it. Fast beats thinking.”
KennBlueDragon “Fast gets you killed. Look for tells.”
space_fan “Rubber tiles… they look thinner.”
BLEUG! “They want us to test with bodies.”
Golden “I hate ‘at least one bad tile’ games.”
Toad “If it’s weight-based, we can tap-toe.”
Smart2004 “We need a lead tester. Lightest first.”
Snowlaris “No. They punish hesitation.”
CrystalWolf “Or punish confidence. It’s always both.”
Rally “Thirty minutes means panic is part of it.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur “Those ducks look happy. That’s wrong.”
CharliSpirit “So… we guess and die?”
Bofa “We choose who risks first. That’s the real game.”
Lysrix “I don’t want to be the first row.”
Revenant “We rotate. Nobody takes every risk.”
Akarimmu “If someone falls, we learn. Sick, but true.”
Acoustyx “Listen for mechanisms. Tiles that click.”
Ninnginni “It’s a hallway that hates you. Cute.”
Loyal2Schwalb “If it says ‘test fast enough’, it wants missteps.”
kiwi “The second voice will enjoy this.”
JIKOSU “My luck is awful. Please not me.”
lumallie “It wants a story. It wants screams.”
NinjaFlout “Then we deny it drama. Precision.”
Ut “Four wide means lanes. We can probe lanes.”
Axlot “If someone hesitates, I’m stepping past them.”
Shroud “Don’t trust the ‘safe’ platform either.”
WavyDragons “We’re really doing duck bridge death math.”

They’re mid-argument when the speakers cut them off.
Duccarian returns, cheerful like it’s a birthday:
“Tiles are simple. Some are safe. Some are not.”

“On each row, there is at least one bad tile.”

“You may test tiles—if you are fast enough.”

“If you press a rubber tile with 50% of your body weight, it will spring up instantly—killing or badly injuring you.”

“If you step on a solid tile and it is wrong…”
A duck nozzle twitches.
“…boiling water will fire, the tile will drop, and you will be caught and cooked.”

“No other rules. Reach the other side in 30 minutes.”

A horn BLARES.

“Start. Good luck.”

They move.

Toes tap tiles. People hop, shuffle, freeze, then lunge as the timer eats them.

Row 3—Golden commits too much weight to a rubber tile.

It snaps up like a guillotine.

He’s gone before the scream finishes. (DEATH 💀)

Row 6—Toad steps wrong on a “solid” tile.

A duck spits boiling water.

The tile drops.

He vanishes with a flash of steam. (DEATH 💀)

Row 9—CrystalWolf tries to leap a lane, lands heavy—rubber.
The tile erupts. She doesn’t. (DEATH 💀)

Row 12—space_fan tests too confidently—rubber snaps, clips her leg.
She goes down screaming, ankle bent wrong. (BROKEN LIMB 🦴)

Smart2004 yanks her back by the shoulders before the next row triggers.
Snowlaris snarls, “Move her—NOW.”

Row 18—Akarimmu trusts a solid tile.

Boiling water fires.

The tile drops.

He’s gone under the platform in a second. (DEATH 💀)

Row 22—Ninnginni tries to “dance” across two lanes at once.

Rubber catches him mid-step.

The snap is instant. (DEATH 💀)

Row 27—NinjaFlout reaches back to steady someone—puts too much weight down.

Solid tile. Wrong.

The duck spits. The tile falls.

Steam rises. He doesn’t. (DEATH 💀)

Row 31—JIKOSU lands awkward on a safe tile, twisting hard.
He howls and clutches his arm—shoulder out. (BROKEN LIMB 🦴)

The rest push, probe, and sprint in brutal rhythm until hands slam onto the far platform—breathing hard, eyes wild, counting who made it.

The horn sounds again.

The bridge goes silent.

INJURY LOG

space_fan — broken ankle

JIKOSU — dislocated/broken shoulder
They reach the far platform at 24 minutes—not because the bridge got kinder, but because the survivors finally stopped guessing and started solving.

At Row 28, Acoustyx freezes mid-step, head tilted. “The ducks… they click before the bad tile triggers.”

Smart2004 crouches, eyes flicking along the duck nozzles. “They’re pointing. Not random. They’re aiming the safe lane.”

Elv : “Say it.”

Smart2004 exhales, then calls it like a codeword:

“2 — 4 — 1 — 3. Repeat.”
(Second-from-left → far-right → far-left → second-from-right… again and again.)

BLEUG! : “No rhythm breaks. No hero moves.”
Nightmare : “I’m going first.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “If it flips, it flips. Keep moving.”

They run the sequence.

CharliSpirit whispers counts under her breath.
Lysrix stares at lane numbers, not the water.
WavyDragons hisses, “If this is wrong I’m haunting the ducks.”
Loyal2Schwalb mutters, “I hate puzzles that eat people,” and steps perfectly on count.
kiwi stays tight with Snowlaris. “Don’t drift.”
Snowlaris : “I’m here.”

KennBlueDragon catches space_fan when her ankle threatens to fold. “Lean on me.”
space_fan bites back a sound and nods.
Rally supports JIKOSU under the good arm. “Breathe. Step on my count.”
JIKOSU : “Just—don’t let me slow you down.”

Hands slam onto the far platform.

No horn. No praise. Just silence that says: you’re not special… you’re just not dead.
Decent food is waiting—nothing tailored, nothing cruel. Just enough.

lumallie eats without looking at anyone.
Axlot mutters, “Next time, someone else tests first.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur lets out a broken laugh and wipes his face. “We actually cracked it…”

They stay there for the rest of the day—too exhausted to explore, too afraid to leave the “safe” platform.

Small clusters form by distance alone.

Elv checks everyone’s breathing like it’s a roster.
WavyDragons sits with his back to the wall, staring at the bridge.
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 watches the water like it owes him a rematch.
Acoustyx keeps listening to nothing, like nothing is loud.
Bofa counts heads twice, then a third time, like counting can undo loss.
CharliSpirit avoids looking at the empty spaces.

Then the bedtime alarms begin—low, pulsing.

They stand.

KennBlueDragon and Elv take space_fan between them.
Rally keeps JIKOSU upright while Smart2004 sets the pace.

They follow the guiding lights back.

Some notice something different—and keep it to themselves.

No rising hum.
No crawling electric wall.

Shroud notices first and says nothing.
Bofa notices next and keeps his face blank.
Rally notices too, eyes narrowing… but he doesn’t share it.

They reach the dorms.

Inside: medical supplies, neatly arranged like someone expected this exact outcome.

Bandages. Splints. Disinfectant. Painkillers.

Snowlaris exhales once, sharp. “So it wants us alive.”
space_fan looks at the kit, then at the room. “Guess we’re the medics.”

Snowlaris kneels by JIKOSU, steady hands, no wasted motion.
space_fan slides supplies closer, wincing through her own pain. “Hold still.”

JIKOSU hisses as the joint is set.
space_fan points at her ankle. “Now do me.”
Snowlaris splints it tight. “You’re not walking on that raw.”

Around them, everyone settles into guarded routines:

Smart2004 stands by the door, arms folded.
Nightmare sits facing outward like a boulder that refuses surprise.
Toad is gone—nobody says the name.
BLEUG! mutters, “They’re rationing survival.”
WavyDragons paces once, twice. “No fence tonight… I don’t like that.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 smiles without humor. “Means something else is coming.”
KennBlueDragon watches the hallway lights. “Tools mean they want a longer story.”
CharliSpirit whispers to the medics, “Thank you.”
Lysrix says quietly, “I can’t sleep.”
Revenant answers, “You will. In pieces.”

kiwi leans toward Snowlaris. “That second voice is going to say good night.”
Snowlaris : “Yeah.”

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur places a rubber duck at his bedside like a charm.
Loyal2Schwalb lies down with shoes on. “If I hear a horn, I’m already running.”
Ut checks the door seam again. “Same lock. Same trap.”
Axlot drags something heavy closer. “If someone rushes me, they pay.”
lumallie stares into a dark corner. “It’s teaching us to hate each other.”
Acoustyx replies softly, “And it’s working.”
Shroud settles into the far corner. “Hate is focus.”

They finally go still.
The lights cut out.

Pitch-black—except the faint floor-glow that makes shadows look like they’re standing up.

Static crawls through the speakers.

Then the second voice, gentle in the way a blade is gentle:

“Good night, tributes.”

A pause.

“Sleep carefully.”

The speakers click off.
DAY 3 ENDED
