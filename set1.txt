DAY 1 - THE BEGINNING
Fog hangs over the pond like a low ceiling. The floating platform sits trapped in a ring of floodlights—bright enough to hurt your eyes, yet somehow still a closed space. The air feels staged. The water feels like it’s listening.

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian : “Good evening, contestants. Welcome to The Duck Pond. Tonight is orientation. No games. No exits. Behave.”

The speakers click off.

Silence… then a second voice slides in—lower, slower, and far too close.

“Thank you for arriving.”

A cold pressure settles in the light.

kiwi feels it first—like a chill under the ribs.
Snowlaris feels it right after—like something smiling behind her shoulder.

kiwi : “Snow… did you feel that?”
Snowlaris : “Yeah. That wasn’t part of the show.”

The second voice hums, amused.

space_fan : “Why do the ducks look like cameras?”
BLEUG! : “If this is a prank, it’s got a budget.”
Golden : “I hate stages. Stages mean scripts.”
Toad : “There’s no wind. The air’s… trapped.”
Godly_Aura : “Lights, water, sound system—someone planned every angle.”
Smart2004 : “Okay. Everyone stop talking over each other. We need a read on the room.”
CrystalWolf : “The room is the problem. It’s too perfect.”
Nightmare : “If something jumps out, I’m jumping back harder.”
Elv : “Breathe slow. Panic makes noise.”
Rally : “I don’t like ponds. Too much hiding space.”

The second voice whispers, pleased: “Good. You’re listening.”
A ripple rolls across the pond—no wind, no splash. Just a line of motion like a finger dragging through water.

WavyDragons : “This is insane. Who even builds a place like this?”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “Doesn’t matter. Built things can break.”
KennBlueDragon : “I almost fell off the edge. The platform tilted. It’s… moving.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur : “I’m naming the ducks. If we’re trapped, we’re at least doing it with morale.”
janhk. : “No seams. No weak boards. Whoever made this expected us to test it.”

Near the center, people bunch up under the harshest light like moths forced into order.

CharliSpirit : “So… is there a formal introduction? Or do we just stand here until something happens?”
Schwonkey : “Hello? Whoever’s on the speakers—what’s the objective?”
Bofa : “Don’t ask it questions like it’s human.”
Lysrix : “I don’t like the second voice. It sounds… happy.”
Revenant : “Pair up. Nobody stays alone. That’s how places like this pick you off.”
Akarimmu : “Count heads. If someone disappears, we notice instantly.”
Acoustyx : “Quiet. Listen between the words. That’s where it hides.”

The second voice returns, softer than before:

“Excellent instincts.”

The floodlights brighten a fraction—like the platform is leaning closer.
Shadows shift at the edge of the platform where the light fails to reach the water.

Ninnginni : “This is a reality show for monsters. Lovely.”
Loyal2Schwalb : “Rule one: never take anything offered by a duck.”
JIKOSU : “I can hop the rail—” (He grabs it.) “No. It’s hot. Why is it hot?”
lumallie : “Because it wants you to stay. That’s the only rule that matters.”
NinjaFlout : “Then we make our own rules. We watch. We wait. We strike when it slips.”
Ut : “I’m going to check the far side.” (He steps into a shadow—then reappears two meters away.) “Okay. The shadows are… wrong.”
Axlot : “I found a hatch—fake. Painted on. Someone thinks that’s funny.”
Shroud : “We’re being measured. Every word, every flinch.”

The second voice sighs, satisfied.

“Orientation is simple: learn each other. Learn the platform. Learn fear.”

A line of white doors rises from the floor—clean, silent, evenly spaced. Not cages. Not rooms. Something in-between.

Toad : “Those weren’t there five minutes ago.”
Smart2004 : “Everyone pick a door near someone you trust. No wandering.”
Snowlaris : “Kiwi. Stay close.”
kiwi : “I’m not leaving your side.”

One by one, the doors open into bright, empty compartments—sterile and waiting.

The floodlights dim just enough to remind everyone how dark the pond really is.

The second voice gives a final whisper, almost gentle:

“Sleep. Tomorrow, you’ll understand why you were chosen.”

The doors slide shut.

And Day 1 ends with the pond perfectly still—like it’s holding a secret under the platform.
Night falls like a switch being flipped.

A hidden hatchline opens along the platform’s edge, and the floor guides them off—not with doors, but with a single trail of lights embedded into the ground, pale and cold, like runway markers.

Beyond that line: total darkness.

Behind them: a wall of crackling light slides forward every few seconds—an electric, solid curtain that hums with pressure.

They try the sides. Nothing. Just black.

They try to stop. The wall inches closer.

JIKOSU reaches back on impulse—just to test it.

A tiny tsssk.

The tip of his finger turns to ash and falls away like burned paper.

He yanks his hand back, choking on his own breath.

The whole group breaks at once—scrambling, shouting, running—only to realize the same truth over and over:

There is no exit behind them.

There is no exit to the sides.

There is only the line of ground-lights… and the unknown ahead.

So they move.

Minutes become a blur. The hall never ends—just darkness, lights, and the constant closing whisper of electricity.
Then, finally, the lights widen into a circle.

A set of doors rises out of nothing—matte white, featureless, too clean for a place this wrong.

Speakers hidden somewhere in the ceiling crackle alive.

That second voice returns—low, calm, and far too close.

“Welcome to the dormitory corridor.”

The lights brighten just enough to show what they’re standing in: a long, windowless hall wrapped around the pond like a collar, suspended over black water. Doors line both sides, identical, numbered in faint gray.

“The lights on the ground are your path. Step off them, and you will learn why you should not.”

The electric wall pauses at the far end of the hallway, still humming—waiting.

“This is not a prison,” the voice says, almost amused. “It is a preparation chamber. You will sleep. You will rest. You will listen.”

A soft click—every door unlocks at once.

“Choose a room. Close it. Do not open it again until morning.”

The speakers go dead.

And only then do they all finally speak.

space_fan : “Okay—nope. I hate how it knows what we’ll do before we do it.”
BLEUG! : “That wall is a warning. Next time it won’t be a fingertip.”
Golden : “Doors with no handles. Great. Love that for us.”
Toad : “Stay on the lights. No hero moves. We survive by being boring.”
Godly_Aura : “The corridor is a test. It’s measuring fear response and compliance.”
Smart2004 : “Pair up. Rooms near each other. If someone goes quiet, we notice.”
Snowlaris : “Kiwi—same door block. Right now.”
CrystalWolf : “I want to believe it’s just theatrics. But my stomach doesn’t.”

Nightmare : “If it wants rules, fine. I’ll follow rules… until I’m strong enough to break them.”
Elv : “We keep calm. We keep structure. Panic is what it’s fishing for.”
Rally : “I’m not sleeping with my back to a wall that moves.”
WavyDragons : “So we’re really doing this… rooms and curfew and psycho speakers.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “It bleeds, it loses. Whatever it is—eventually.”
KennBlueDragon : “My hands are shaking. I hate that they’re shaking.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur : “I’m taking a duck with me. If I’m doomed, I’m not doomed alone.”
janhk. : “Doors unlock together. That means it controls them together. Remember that.”

CharliSpirit : “I’m officially requesting a normal night. Just once.”
Schwonkey : “We need a headcount every hour. This place is built for disappearances.”
Bofa : “No windows. No clocks. It’s trying to remove time from us.”
Lysrix : “I don’t like the way it said ‘learn.’ Like we’re the lesson.”
Revenant : “Alright—rooms close together. No wandering. We make it to morning.”
Akarimmu : “If anyone’s door opens in the night—shout. Don’t investigate alone.”
Acoustyx : “It wants us isolated. So we do the opposite.”

Ninnginni : “A corridor with rules and a smiling voice. Charming. Absolutely charming.”
Loyal2Schwalb : “If the floor lights change color, we run. I don’t care where.”
kiwi : “I knew it was wrong. I just didn’t know it was this wrong.”
JIKOSU : “My finger… I— I’m not touching anything ever again.”
lumallie : “It’s not trying to kill us tonight. It’s trying to train us.”
NinjaFlout : “Then we train back. Quietly. Patiently.”
Ut : “I walked ten minutes and didn’t pass a single turn. The hallway loops.”
Axlot : “If it wants us in rooms… I’m sleeping with something heavy in my hand.”
Shroud : “This isn’t a dorm. It’s a funnel. Tomorrow is the blade.”
DAY 2 — THE FEAST

The dorm doors unlock at the same time. A line of pale floor-lights leads them into a new room: a long hall with one enormous table, perfectly centered under brutal overhead lamps.

Plates slide into place by unseen hands.

Not “food.” Their food. The exact kind that hits a memory before it hits the tongue.

space_fan freezes. “No way… this is exactly—”
BLEUG! eyes her plate like it’s evidence. “Someone’s been watching me eat.”
Golden doesn’t sit right away. “If I eat it, it means I’m accepting the rules.”
Toad takes one bite, then exhales like he forgot how. “They got it perfect.”
Godly_Aura whispers, “This is data collection disguised as kindness.”
Smart2004 stares down his tray. “This is psychological warfare. Comfort as a leash.”
Snowlaris doesn’t touch anything at first. “It knows too much.”
CrystalWolf leans close to her plate and sniffs. “No poison. That’s… worse.”

Nightmare eats like it’s a timed challenge. “Food is fuel. Don’t overthink it.”
Elv takes smaller bites, counting. “It wants us calm.”
Rally taps the table once. “If the food’s real, the danger is real too.”
WavyDragons forces a laugh that doesn’t land. “So it’s a ‘welcome dinner’ for kidnapped people. Nice.”

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian : “Eat. Every favorite has a price.”

The speakers click off again—like the host stepped out of the room and left the door locked behind him.

More plates arrive, perfectly timed, perfectly tailored—like a hidden helper is walking a checklist of their souls.

Vanarknees 🇦🇷 chews slowly. “I don’t trust gifts.”
KennBlueDragon (Rally) finishes first—too fast, like he’s racing the idea of being watched. “There’s paper under my tray.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur holds up his dessert like a trophy. “Okay… this is unfairly good.”
janhk. flips his fork, checking the metal. “Even the cutlery is selected.”

CharliSpirit swallows and whispers, “It tastes like home. That’s not okay.”
Schwonkey wipes his mouth. “Alright. Everyone stop. If there are rules, we read them together.”
Bofa watches the ceiling. “Rules are never for our benefit.”
Lysrix (she) looks sick with dread. “If it can do this… what else can it do?”
Revenant nods once. “We stay coordinated.”
Akarimmu sets his plate aside. “Read the paper.”
Acoustyx speaks quietly. “Read it out loud. So it can’t be changed later.”

Rally stands up, unfolds the sheet, and reads:

THE DUCK POND — STANDARD RULES (Orientation Set)

No running unless instructed. Running creates “incidents.”

No damaging lights (floor-lights, floodlights, or “pond markers”).

No crossing railings without permission.

No hiding during announcements.

No touching the water unless a game requires it.

If a door locks, it is locked for a reason.

Teams are absolute. Helping the opposing team counts as sabotage.

You may speak, bargain, threaten, or pray. The pond does not care.

[LORE ONLY: Rally’s Luck-Curse — he will constantly get into trouble, never be injured, and will only die when two remain.]

Rally lowers the paper. “That’s it. No exit clause. No mercy clause.”

The speakers crackle again—warmer, almost friendly.

“The first challenge begins now.”

A hiss slides through vents. Sweet. Heavy. Fast.

One by one, knees weaken. Plates blur. The table tilts sideways into darkness.

They wake to a soft elevator hum—individual compartments, dim and shaking, with a single strip of light on the floor.

Then the second voice enters the elevator speakers—low and calm, like it’s inside their skulls.

“Hunters and Ducks.”

It speaks the rules into them until the words stick.

You will be assigned a role: HUNTER or DUCK.

Hunters may cooperate with Hunters. Ducks may cooperate with Ducks.

Ducks receive oxygen masks. Hunters cannot steal or remove them.

Ducks may use underwater tunnels for up to 10 minutes per Duck.
(Time is tracked. The pond knows.)

Ducks cannot drag Hunters underwater. You may only fight, block, or force mistakes.

The game ends when a Hunter drowns or when a Duck is killed.

Step off the marked ground in the arena and you will learn why you shouldn’t.

Somewhere in the darkness between floors—

kiwi feels it again. That same chill, deep and wrong.
Snowlaris feels it too, and meets his eyes through the elevator’s dim glass — it followed us.

KennBlueDragon wakes sharply, grabbing the rail.
“Yeah… nobody drugged us just to be nice.”

The elevator jolts.

The doors open. 

They spill out onto a massive arena: a crystal-clear puddle the size of a lake, surrounded by glass walls and blinding lights. Beneath the water: faint shadows of tunnels that braid like veins.

A rack of oxygen masks waits near the edge—only on one side.

A panel lights up with roles.

HUNTERS (16)

DUCKS (16)

BLEUG! Toad Snowlaris CrystalWolf Rally GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur janhk. CharliSpirit Lysrix Ninnginni Loyal2Schwalb kiwi JIKOSU NinjaFlout Ut Shroud

The arena goes quiet—then everyone speaks at once, trying to pretend they’re not afraid.

Nightmare growls, “Hunters—tight formation.”
Elv nods. “Control the shoreline. Don’t chase into water.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 cracks his neck. “Let the ducks come to us.”
KennBlueDragon exhales slowly. “So we wait for mistakes… got it.”
space_fan squints at the tunnels. “Clear water doesn’t make this safer.”
Smart2004 points. “We mark tunnel exits. We trap the surface.”
Bofa mutters, “Rules that specific mean someone already watched this happen.”
lumallie whispers, “No trusting. Not even inside teams.”
Axlot smiles thinly. “If one of them pops up, I finish it.”

On the other side—

BLEUG! grabs a mask and snaps, “Ducks—don’t waste tunnel time.”
Snowlaris (to kiwi) “That voice… it’s here.”
kiwi swallows. “Yeah. And it knows our moves.”
Lysrix adjusts her mask straps with shaking hands. “Ten minutes. Don’t panic-burn it.”
Ut crouches at the waterline. “Tunnels mean flanks. We can appear anywhere.”
janhk. squints into the water. “The tunnels have turns. It’s a maze.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “Please tell me this ends without… that.”
Shroud says quietly, “It won’t.”

The floodlights intensify.

The water goes perfectly still.

And somewhere under the surface, something moves—

like the pond is smiling. 
A horn detonates over the arena—so loud the glass walls vibrate.

The match is live.

Hunters spread exactly as planned: a hard line on the shoreline, eyes on the water, backs to the glass.

Nightmare barks, “Hold the edge. Don’t step in.”
Elv points low, “Watch the shadows. They’ll surface where you’re weakest.”
WavyDragons mutters, “I hate water games.”
Smart2004 drags a marker line in the wet sand, “Exit points. Memorize them.”
Bofa keeps scanning the tunnels, “They’re not gone. They’re just underneath.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 cracks his neck, “Let them try something.”
lumallie whispers, “No hero plays.”
Revenant nods, “We move as one.”
space_fan steadies herself, “If I see bubbles, I call it.”
Golden shifts stance, “They want panic. Don’t give it.”
Acoustyx says quietly, “Listen. Even water has footsteps.”
Akarimmu rolls shoulders, “If one surfaces, we collapse.”
Axlot smiles thinly, “Surface kills only.”
KennBlueDragon keeps voice low, “Nobody gets separated.”
Godly_Aura watches the water, “Patterns. Find the pattern.”
Schwonkey swallows, “I’m not dying in a puddle.”

On the other side, Ducks move like a silent current.

BLEUG! snaps a mask on, “No wasted tunnel time.”
Lysrix tightens straps, “Ten minutes. Don’t burn it.”
Snowlaris leans to kiwi, “That voice is still here.”
kiwi nods once, “I know.”
CrystalWolf murmurs, “We bait them. Don’t chase.”
Rally taps the lights, “We strike when they think they’ve won.”
Ninnginni exhales, “Alright. We dance.”
Loyal2Schwalb points at the glass, “No exits. Only angles.”
NinjaFlout bows once, “Then we become the angle.”
Ut slips to the edge, “I’ll watch their backs.”
Shroud says quietly, “Let them feel clever.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur whispers, “If I die, name a duck after me.”
Toad tests seal, “Tunnels first.”
JIKOSU stares at the water, “I hate that it’s so clear.”
CharliSpirit breathes in, “Okay… okay…”
janhk. squints into the depths, “The maze is real.”

For a while, it’s slow. Careful. Almost chess.

Then it happens.

JIKOSU slips on the wet lip of the shore—just one mistake.

Hunters pounce.

Nightmare lunges first, grabbing the collar.
Schwonkey pins the arms.
Godly_Aura holds the mask up, “Don’t let them drop back in!”
Smart2004 steps in, “We got one!”

For half a second, victory.

They don’t see the tunnel behind them open.
Water parts.

Twelve Ducks erupt out in a coordinated surge.

BLEUG! comes up first, “NOW!”
Snowlaris hits the shore, “Move!”
CrystalWolf drives shoulder-first.
Rally snaps, “Heads down—force the slip!”
kiwi and Shroud flank left, cutting escape.
Lysrix darts in, “Don’t let them breathe!”
Ninnginni shoves forward, “Into the shallow!”
Loyal2Schwalb twists an arm, “Fall.”
NinjaFlout sweeps a leg, “Clean.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur charges, “GET OFF HIM!”
janhk. surfaces last, “More tunnels—”

The Hunters stagger—boots sliding.

Ducks don’t drag them under.

They shove. Strike. Force mistakes.

Schwonkey loses footing—back hits water.
Godly_Aura reaches to pull him—slips too.

A shallow puddle becomes a drowning pit when no one can stand.

Schwonkey gasps once—water fills lungs.
Godly_Aura claws for grip—finds none.

Nightmare hauls himself back onto dry ground.
Smart2004 stumbles away coughing.

Two Hunters don’t come back up.

The alarm screams.

The horn blares.

The game ends.
The crystal water drains instantly.

Ducks scramble out. Hunters stagger back.

Metal shutters slam through the tunnels—one after another.

A muffled pounding echoes from below.

janhk. is still inside.

The last water disappears. The tunnel seals.

Breathing turns ragged… then silent.

The lights stay bright.

They always stay bright.

DEATH LOG

Schwonkey — Drowned (lost footing during ambush)
Godly_Aura — Drowned (slipped during rescue attempt)
janhk. — Suffocated (trapped in sealed tunnel)

NIGHT 2

10:00 PM.

The arena doesn’t need a clock—everyone knows the moment the electric wall ignites on the far side with that familiar hum.

Nightmare snaps, “MOVE!” and the survivors lurch into motion.
Elv keeps the pace steady, “Don’t sprint into a fall. Keep breathing.”
Smart2004 points to the floor-lights, “Eyes down. Follow the line. No detours.”
space_fan limps but doesn’t stop, wiping water off her face with a shaking hand.
KennBlueDragon grabs someone’s sleeve and hauls them forward, “Keep going. Don’t look back.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “They were right there…” and forces her feet to keep moving.
Akarimmu glances over his shoulder once, “It’s closer. Faster tonight.”
Acoustyx doesn’t speak—he just listens to the hum like it’s counting them.
BLEUG! shoves ahead through the dark, “Stay on the lights. Stay together.”
Lysrix stumbles, catches herself, “I’m fine—just—keep moving.”
Snowlaris stays tight with kiwi, “Don’t separate. Not now.”
kiwi nods once, jaw clenched, “I’m here.”
WavyDragons pants, “I hate this place. I hate it.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 spits to the side, “When I find whoever built this—”
Rally looks back just long enough to see the wall crawl forward, “Yeah… no. Keep running.”
Golden mutters, “It’s herding us,” and doesn’t slow down.

The corridor opens ahead—dark, endless, only the ground lights to follow.

They don’t search for exits anymore.

They just run forward because forward is the only direction that isn’t death. 

Dorm doors slide open. No welcome. No announcement. Just silence and harsh light.

Toad checks the door seam, “Same lock pattern. Same trap potential.”
CrystalWolf whispers, “It ended the game the moment it wanted to. Remember that.”
Bofa stands near the center, eyes scanning faces, “Tonight is where alliances start. Or vendettas.”
Revenant tries to sound steady, “Rooms close together. No solo walks. If you hear a door—call it.”
Ninnginni sits on the edge of a bed, “So this is the ‘rest’ part. Charming.”
Loyal2Schwalb keeps shoes on, “If the floor-lights flicker, I’m running. I don’t care where.”
JIKOSU flexes his hand like it still hurts, “I’m not touching anything ever again.”
lumallie stares at the ceiling, “We’re being taught. Trained. Broken into shape.”
NinjaFlout speaks quietly to no one in particular, “Then we learn faster than it expects.”
Ut tests the hallway edge, then backs away, “No blind corners. Good. Bad.”
Axlot drags something heavy closer to his bed, “If someone rushes me, they’re eating steel.”
Shroud takes the farthest corner, “Trust is a luxury. Don’t spend it.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur places a rubber duck on the bedside like a ward, “If I’m going down, I’m going down with moral support.”

Small groups form without permission. Some by friendship. Some by fear. Some by pure hatred.

Doors close. Breathing slows. Eyes stay open.

One by one they lie down—still listening, still watching—

not trusting anybody.

Not even themselves.

DAY 3 - THE DUCK TILES

A static SCREEE rips through the dorms. Everyone bolts upright.

The second voice slides in, calm and cruel: “Eating time.”

The doors unlock. The hall is darker than usual. The guiding floor-lights lead them to the table.

And this time… it’s the opposite of comfort.

Perfectly edible. Perfectly warm. Every plate is their most hated food.

Lysrix stares like it’s a prank. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”
space_fan gags and covers her mouth. “No. No way.”
Nightmare pokes it once. “This is disrespectful.”
lumallie doesn’t touch his fork. “It wants us miserable.”
kiwi mutters, “They know. They know.”

A few hands drift toward swapping plates.

The second voice snaps in instantly: “Switching food is forbidden. Vomiting is forbidden.”
A pause. Then softer: “Eat. Or starve.”

No one argues. Not out loud.

They force bites. They chew like punishment. They swallow like it’s a rule.

KennBlueDragon grimaces, “This is… personal.”
Rally wipes his mouth, “They’re testing obedience.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 growls, “They’re testing how fast we break.”

The “break” ends early because nobody can really eat.

They sit anyway. Talking low.

Smart2004 whispers, “Next game is soon. They’re weakening us.”
Snowlaris glances at kiwi. “That second voice… it’s getting bolder.”
CharliSpirit breathes, “I miss normal fear.”
WavyDragons mutters, “I’d rather fight than do this.”

Then silence. An hour of it.

The door opens again.

All lights die—except the guiding floor-lights.

And from behind the wall… that terrifying electric hum returns.
They step onto the line without being told. Calmer now. Not braver—just trained.

Water slaps below somewhere unseen. The hum follows like a leash.

A huge room opens ahead.

A platform—4 tiles wide, 45 long—mosaic patterned with rubber-looking tiles and solid ones.
On both sides: dark water.
At the far end: a “safe” platform.

Along the edges sit countless rubber ducks, each with a water-gun-like nozzle in its mouth, aimed at the tiles.

Nobody knows what it means.

Everyone talks anyway—because silence feels like consent.

Nightmare “This is a bridge. A rigged one.”
Elv “Pattern game. Memory or sacrifice.”
WavyDragons “Those ducks are weapons. I can feel it.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 “We sprint it. Fast beats thinking.”
KennBlueDragon “Fast gets you killed. Look for tells.”
space_fan “Rubber tiles… they look thinner.”
BLEUG! “They want us to test with bodies.”
Golden “I hate ‘at least one bad tile’ games.”
Toad “If it’s weight-based, we can tap-toe.”
Smart2004 “We need a lead tester. Lightest first.”
Snowlaris “No. They punish hesitation.”
CrystalWolf “Or punish confidence. It’s always both.”
Rally “Thirty minutes means panic is part of it.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur “Those ducks look happy. That’s wrong.”
CharliSpirit “So… we guess and die?”
Bofa “We choose who risks first. That’s the real game.”
Lysrix “I don’t want to be the first row.”
Revenant “We rotate. Nobody takes every risk.”
Akarimmu “If someone falls, we learn. Sick, but true.”
Acoustyx “Listen for mechanisms. Tiles that click.”
Ninnginni “It’s a hallway that hates you. Cute.”
Loyal2Schwalb “If it says ‘test fast enough’, it wants missteps.”
kiwi “The second voice will enjoy this.”
JIKOSU “My luck is awful. Please not me.”
lumallie “It wants a story. It wants screams.”
NinjaFlout “Then we deny it drama. Precision.”
Ut “Four wide means lanes. We can probe lanes.”
Axlot “If someone hesitates, I’m stepping past them.”
Shroud “Don’t trust the ‘safe’ platform either.”
WavyDragons “We’re really doing duck bridge death math.”

They’re mid-argument when the speakers cut them off.
Duccarian returns, cheerful like it’s a birthday:
“Tiles are simple. Some are safe. Some are not.”

“On each row, there is at least one bad tile.”

“You may test tiles—if you are fast enough.”

“If you press a rubber tile with 50% of your body weight, it will spring up instantly—killing or badly injuring you.”

“If you step on a solid tile and it is wrong…”
A duck nozzle twitches.
“…boiling water will fire, the tile will drop, and you will be caught and cooked.”

“No other rules. Reach the other side in 30 minutes.”

A horn BLARES.

“Start. Good luck.”

They move.

Toes tap tiles. People hop, shuffle, freeze, then lunge as the timer eats them.

Row 3—Golden commits too much weight to a rubber tile.

It snaps up like a guillotine.

He’s gone before the scream finishes. (DEATH 💀)

Row 6—Toad steps wrong on a “solid” tile.

A duck spits boiling water.

The tile drops.

He vanishes with a flash of steam. (DEATH 💀)

Row 9—CrystalWolf tries to leap a lane, lands heavy—rubber.
The tile erupts. She doesn’t. (DEATH 💀)

Row 12—space_fan tests too confidently—rubber snaps, clips her leg.
She goes down screaming, ankle bent wrong. (BROKEN LIMB 🦴)

Smart2004 yanks her back by the shoulders before the next row triggers.
Snowlaris snarls, “Move her—NOW.”

Row 18—Akarimmu trusts a solid tile.

Boiling water fires.

The tile drops.

He’s gone under the platform in a second. (DEATH 💀)

Row 22—Ninnginni tries to “dance” across two lanes at once.

Rubber catches him mid-step.

The snap is instant. (DEATH 💀)

Row 27—NinjaFlout reaches back to steady someone—puts too much weight down.

Solid tile. Wrong.

The duck spits. The tile falls.

Steam rises. He doesn’t. (DEATH 💀)

Row 31—JIKOSU lands awkward on a safe tile, twisting hard.
He howls and clutches his arm—shoulder out. (BROKEN LIMB 🦴)

The rest push, probe, and sprint in brutal rhythm until hands slam onto the far platform—breathing hard, eyes wild, counting who made it.

The horn sounds again.

The bridge goes silent.

DEATH LOG

Golden — rubber tile spring (instant kill)

Toad — boiling water + drop (cooked)

CrystalWolf — rubber tile spring (instant kill)

Akarimmu — boiling water + drop (cooked)

Ninnginni — rubber tile spring (instant kill)

NinjaFlout — boiling water + drop (cooked)

INJURY LOG

space_fan — broken ankle

JIKOSU — dislocated/broken shoulder
They reach the far platform at 24 minutes—not because the bridge got kinder, but because the survivors finally stopped guessing and started solving.

At Row 28, Acoustyx freezes mid-step, head tilted. “The ducks… they click before the bad tile triggers.”

Smart2004 crouches, eyes flicking along the duck nozzles. “They’re pointing. Not random. They’re aiming the safe lane.”

Elv : “Say it.”

Smart2004 exhales, then calls it like a codeword:

“2 — 4 — 1 — 3. Repeat.”
(Second-from-left → far-right → far-left → second-from-right… again and again.)

BLEUG! : “No rhythm breaks. No hero moves.”
Nightmare : “I’m going first.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 : “If it flips, it flips. Keep moving.”

They run the sequence.

CharliSpirit whispers counts under her breath.
Lysrix stares at lane numbers, not the water.
WavyDragons hisses, “If this is wrong I’m haunting the ducks.”
Loyal2Schwalb mutters, “I hate puzzles that eat people,” and steps perfectly on count.
kiwi stays tight with Snowlaris. “Don’t drift.”
Snowlaris : “I’m here.”

KennBlueDragon catches space_fan when her ankle threatens to fold. “Lean on me.”
space_fan bites back a sound and nods.
Rally supports JIKOSU under the good arm. “Breathe. Step on my count.”
JIKOSU : “Just—don’t let me slow you down.”

Hands slam onto the far platform.

No horn. No praise. Just silence that says: you’re not special… you’re just not dead.
Decent food is waiting—nothing tailored, nothing cruel. Just enough.

lumallie eats without looking at anyone.
Axlot mutters, “Next time, someone else tests first.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur lets out a broken laugh and wipes his face. “We actually cracked it…”

They stay there for the rest of the day—too exhausted to explore, too afraid to leave the “safe” platform.

Small clusters form by distance alone.

Elv checks everyone’s breathing like it’s a roster.
WavyDragons sits with his back to the wall, staring at the bridge.
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 watches the water like it owes him a rematch.
Acoustyx keeps listening to nothing, like nothing is loud.
Bofa counts heads twice, then a third time, like counting can undo loss.
CharliSpirit avoids looking at the empty spaces.

Then the bedtime alarms begin—low, pulsing.

They stand.

KennBlueDragon and Elv take space_fan between them.
Rally keeps JIKOSU upright while Smart2004 sets the pace.

They follow the guiding lights back.

Some notice something different—and keep it to themselves.

No rising hum.
No crawling electric wall.

Shroud notices first and says nothing.
Bofa notices next and keeps his face blank.
Rally notices too, eyes narrowing… but he doesn’t share it.

They reach the dorms.

Inside: medical supplies, neatly arranged like someone expected this exact outcome.

Bandages. Splints. Disinfectant. Painkillers.

Snowlaris exhales once, sharp. “So it wants us alive.”
space_fan looks at the kit, then at the room. “Guess we’re the medics.”

Snowlaris kneels by JIKOSU, steady hands, no wasted motion.
space_fan slides supplies closer, wincing through her own pain. “Hold still.”

JIKOSU hisses as the joint is set.
space_fan points at her ankle. “Now do me.”
Snowlaris splints it tight. “You’re not walking on that raw.”

Around them, everyone settles into guarded routines:

Smart2004 stands by the door, arms folded.
Nightmare sits facing outward like a boulder that refuses surprise.
Toad is gone—nobody says the name.
BLEUG! mutters, “They’re rationing survival.”
WavyDragons paces once, twice. “No fence tonight… I don’t like that.”
Vanarknees 🇦🇷 smiles without humor. “Means something else is coming.”
KennBlueDragon watches the hallway lights. “Tools mean they want a longer story.”
CharliSpirit whispers to the medics, “Thank you.”
Lysrix says quietly, “I can’t sleep.”
Revenant answers, “You will. In pieces.”

kiwi leans toward Snowlaris. “That second voice is going to say good night.”
Snowlaris : “Yeah.”

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur places a rubber duck at his bedside like a charm.
Loyal2Schwalb lies down with shoes on. “If I hear a horn, I’m already running.”
Ut checks the door seam again. “Same lock. Same trap.”
Axlot drags something heavy closer. “If someone rushes me, they pay.”
lumallie stares into a dark corner. “It’s teaching us to hate each other.”
Acoustyx replies softly, “And it’s working.”
Shroud settles into the far corner. “Hate is focus.”

They finally go still.
The lights cut out.

Pitch-black—except the faint floor-glow that makes shadows look like they’re standing up.

Static crawls through the speakers.

Then the second voice, gentle in the way a blade is gentle:

“Good night, tributes.”

A pause.

“Sleep carefully.”

The speakers click off.
