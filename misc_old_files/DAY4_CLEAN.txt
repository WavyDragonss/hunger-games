[[DAY]]
DAY 4 — FREEZE TAG

A harsh alarm drills through the dorms. Not the usual static—this one is sharp, mechanical, impatient.

Everyone sits up at once.

And for the first time since Day 1, there something new on the wall:

A huge red digital clock.

12:00 PM.

Elv squints at it. “A clock… now?”
WavyDragons rubs his eyes. “So they can tell time when they want.”
Rally stares without blinking. “That means schedules. That means pacing.”
Polaris keeps her voice low to kiwi. “It feels like a countdown.”
kiwi nods once. “Or a threat.”

The speakers crackle.

Duccarian: “Clean up. Reset. You’ve earned the privilege of pretending you’re normal.”

A dispensing bin opens with a hiss.

Nightmare shoves his old clothes in like he throwing away a bad memory.
Vanarknees drops his in without looking. “I’m not letting this place keep pieces of me.”
lumallie folds her shirt once before tossing it. “It collecting. That bin is a mouth.”
Acoustyx watches the bin a second too long. “Don’t put your hand in.”

They’re directed one at a time into a dressing room.

space_fan limps in first, jaw tight, and comes out in clean clothes that don’t fit the pain.
KennBlueDragon goes next, rolling his shoulders. “Fresh fabric, same prison.”
CharliSpirit comes out quieter than she went in. “This feels like they’re dressing us for a photo.”
Lysrix checks her sleeves twice, like they might be marked.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur comes out holding his clean shirt like it evidence. “This is way too organized.”
Shroud says nothing—only looks at the clock again, and again.

Food arrives. Better. Not favorites. Not a trap-feast. Just… decent.

Smart2004 eats fast, eyes scanning. “They’re refueling us for something.”
Bofa pushes his tray away, then forces himself to eat anyway. “Fine. I’m not giving them the satisfaction.”
Loyal2Schwalb murmurs, “This is the first normal bite I’ve had in days.”
Ut exhales like he forgot food could taste like food.
Axlot taps the table. “If they’re feeding us, they want us running.”
Revenant nods once. “Or screaming.”

The day crawls.

No games. No announcements. Just the clock burning red.

12:00… 1:00… 2:00… 3:00… 4:00…

Polaris catches herself staring at the reflection in the clock glossy casing—just for a second—like she expects to see something behind her.
kiwi notices and doesn’t ask. He just shifts closer.

Then the clock flips.

5:00 PM.

The alarm slams down again.

The lights snap off—only guiding floor-lights remain.

The second voice slides in, calm and delighted.

“Freeze Tag.”

Silence. Then it begins laying rules like bricks.

[[RULES]]

RULES — FREEZE TAG

Four Catchers. Everyone else: Runners.

If you are tagged, you freeze instantly.

A Runner can unfreeze you by touching you and counting three seconds out loud.

If nobody unfreezes you within 30 seconds, you are eliminated.

If you move while frozen, you are eliminated.

If you attack a Catcher, you are eliminated.

No hiding. No crawling into vents. No leaving the arena.

Catchers may not camp a frozen Runner. Keep moving.

Catchers may not freeze everyone at once. One tag at a time—spread the pressure.

If you have been tagged once, you cannot be tagged again for three minutes after being unfrozen.

The game lasts one hour.

Every 20 minutes, Catchers and Runners may agree to a 5-minute truce. During truce, nobody can be tagged.

Reach the end of the hour alive.

[[NARRATIVE]]

A pause.

“Begin.”

The doors open.

They’re guided into a massive indoor arena—bright, sterile, wrong.

Inflatable duck barriers. Tall foam reeds. Glossy floor lanes that funnel movement. Duck-faced cameras watching from above.

A panel lights up with roles.

CATCHERS (4):
Nightmare
Vanarknees ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·
lumallie
Acoustyx

Nightmare cracks his neck. “Alright.”
Vanarknees smiles without warmth. “Run.”
lumallie whispers, “Don’t blame me. Blame the rules.”
Acoustyx says quietly, “Keep your hands to yourself. I won’t warn twice.”

RUNNERS:
Elv, Rally, WavyDragons, KennBlueDragon, space_fan, Smart2004, Bofa, GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur, CharliSpirit, Lysrix, Revenant, BLEUG!, Loyal2Schwalb, kiwi, Polaris, JIKOSU, Ut, Axlot, Shroud

Rally exhales. “One hour.”
JIKOSU flexes his bad shoulder. “I’m cooked if I get tagged.”
space_fan tightens her brace. “If I go down, don’t stop for me.”
Polaris snaps back, “Don’t say that.”
kiwi points to lanes. “We rotate. We don’t bunch.”
Elv nods. “Pair system. Always two.”
Shroud murmurs, “They want panic traffic jams.”
Lysrix swallows. “Then we don’t give them one.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur looks around for a duck with a name and finds none. “This place hates joy.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “I hate that I’m already counting seconds.”
Revenant raises his voice. “If someone freezes—call it. Loud.”

A horn blares.

Nightmare launches first—fast, direct. Vanarknees cuts angles. lumallie stalks like a shadow. Acoustyx moves like he already knows where people will run.

They scatter.

BLEUG! misjudges the first lane change—Nightmare hand taps her shoulder.

She locks solid mid-step.

BLEUG! yells, “UNFREEZE—” and her eyes flick wildly as the seconds start eating her.

Smart2004 runs for her, but Vanarknees slides between like a wall.

Smart2004 snarls, “Move.”
Vanarknees laughs once. “Can’t camp. I’m just… passing by.”

Polaris starts toward BLEUG!—then lumallie appears, forcing her to veer.

Polaris breathes, “No—no—”
kiwi grabs her sleeve. “Not you. If you go frozen too, it two gone.”

BLEUG! hits 30 seconds.

A duck-camera clicks. A cold hiss bursts from overhead.

BLEUG! is flash-frozen into a brittle statue—then collapses into glittering shards that melt into nothing.

The second voice purrs: “Eliminated.”

space_fan flinches hard. “They’re not â€˜out.’ They’re dead.”

WavyDragons backs up. “Okay. Okay. No mistakes.”

Smart2004 tries to take command again, shouting routes.

Acoustyx tags him mid-sentence.

Smart2004 freezes with one hand still raised like he can command time itself.

Revenant sprints in. “I’ve got you—”

Smart2004 tries to point while frozen—just a twitch.

The second voice cuts in instantly: “Moving while frozen is forbidden.”

A duck nozzle snaps toward Smart2004.

The same cold hiss.

Smart2004 is erased in a heartbeat.

Revenant staggers back, horrified. “He barely moved.”

Rally mutters, “It doesn’t care how small.”
Shroud says quietly, “It cares that it can.”

Bofa sees lumallie cornering CharliSpirit and loses it.

Bofa lunges—an attack.

Acoustyx doesn’t even have to move.

The second voice speaks like a judge: “Attacking a Catcher is forbidden.”

Bofa freezes in place without being touched—like the arena itself grabbed him.

Bofa spits, “Are you kidding—”

He doesn’t get the rest out.

Cold hiss. Click. Gone.

CharliSpirit whispers, “Bofa—” and forces herself to keep running.

At 20 minutes, the horn blares twice.

Nightmare slows. “Truce?”

Elv shouts from across the arena, breath ragged. “Yes. Truce.”

Vanarknees rolls his shoulders. “Five minutes. Don’t waste it.”

The lights shift slightly—like even the arena relaxes.

JIKOSU drops to one knee, clutching his shoulder. “I’m not making another forty minutes like this.”
Lysrix sits hard against a barrier. “I can’t feel my hands.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur wipes his face. “This is cardio for nightmares.”
Polaris checks kiwi face. “You okay?”
kiwi nods, but his eyes flick once to a corner where a duck-shaped camera seems angled too perfectly. “Yeah. I’m okay.”

space_fan adjusts her ankle brace tighter. “If I get tagged, don’t hesitate. Count fast.”
KennBlueDragon answers, “I won’t hesitate.”

Truce ends.

The chase restarts.

Loyal2Schwalb gets clipped by Vanarknees at a lane intersection.

He freezes, eyes wide.

Loyal2Schwalb says, “Please—” like it matters.

Polaris and kiwi both move at once.

Acoustyx cuts off kiwi approach.

Acoustyx: “Keep running.”
kiwi grits his teeth and pivots away, furious.

Polaris tries to reach Loyal2Schwalb—but Nightmare path forces her to break away or be tagged too.

Polaris hisses, “I’m sorry—”

30 seconds.

Loyal2Schwalb is gone in cold glitter.

CharliSpirit covers her mouth. “No…”

Ut gets tagged next—lumallie taps him with almost gentle precision.

Ut freezes mid-stride.

Revenant calls out, “UT, HOLD—HOLD—”

But everyone is too far, lanes too chaotic, fear too loud.

Ut eyes dart as his timer runs.

Rally starts toward him—then Vanarknees angles in, forcing Rally to retreat.

Rally mutters, “Nice.”
Vanarknees grins. “Thanks.”

Ut hits 30.

Gone.

Axlot tries to be clever—baiting Nightmare, juking, laughing once like it still a game.

Nightmare tags him.

Axlot freezes—and immediately tries to force a step anyway, panic overriding logic.

The second voice doesn’t hesitate.

Axlot is eliminated on the spot.

WavyDragons swears under his breath. “Don’t. Move.”

KennBlueDragon gets tagged while helping space_fan over a slick lane.

He freezes with his hand still half-reached toward her, like a promise interrupted.

space_fan spins back, “No—no—”

Polaris limps toward him as fast as her own pain allows.

Vanarknees cuts her off with a smile. “Wrong direction.”

kiwi tries to flank—but Acoustyx mirrors him.

KennBlueDragon eyes lock on space_fan.

KennBlueDragon: “Don’t stop. Don’t waste it.”

space_fan voice breaks. “I can’t—”

KennBlueDragon hits 30 seconds.

He gone.

Polaris goes very still for a beat, then forces herself to move again.

Polaris, barely audible: “We’re not letting this eat us.”

At 40 minutes, the horn blares again.

Another truce is offered.

This time, nobody speaks.

Nightmare finally says, “Truce.”

Elv answers immediately. “Truce.”

Five minutes of breathing. Five minutes of grief swallowed.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur whispers, “We’re down a lot.”
Shroud replies, “We’re down the loud ones.”

Lysrix looks at Polaris and kiwi. “You two… you’re watching corners like you see something.”
Polaris lies smoothly. “Just counting exits.”
kiwi adds, “Just learning angles.”

Truce ends.

Revenant spends the last stretch playing hero—unfreezing two people back-to-back, counting fast, burning his own safety.

Revenant shouts, “THREE—MOVE!”
JIKOSU staggers free, gasping.
Lysrix gets tapped free seconds later by Elv.

Revenant turns—and lumallie is already there.

lumallie tags him.

Revenant freezes standing, still facing forward like he refuses to look defeated.

Elv tries to reach him but Nightmare forces Elv to dodge.

Polaris starts toward Revenant—then hesitates, seeing the angle is death.

Revenant says calmly, “Don’t.”
Revenant eyes flick to the clock. “Live.”

No one reaches him.

30 seconds.

Revenant is eliminated.

The second voice hums, pleased: “Eight.”

The horn blares long and final.

“One hour complete.”

The arena lights soften.

Survivors stand trembling, sweaty, hollow-eyed—counting who remains like it a prayer they don’t believe in.

Polaris finds kiwi again immediately. kiwi finds Polaris just as fast.

Neither of them speaks about the way one duck-camera seems to be facing them both.

Not yet.

[[NIGHT]]
NIGHT 4 — THE DOME

The game ends, but the arena doesn’t feel finished with them.

Vanarknees stands with his hands on his knees, breathing hard, and when he looks up his face is tight with something close to regret.
lumallie won’t meet anyone eyes at all—her jaw keeps working…like she chewing guilt.
Acoustyx wipes his hands on his pants like he can scrub the rules off his skin.

Nightmare doesn’t do any of that.

Nightmare looks… satisfied.

No one really notices. They’re too busy counting who didn’t make it. Too busy swallowing names.

The second voice interrupts the grief like it background noise.

“Rest. Now.”

Instantly, the lights drop.

The path-lights on the floor ignite again—cold, guiding.

They follow without arguing. Not because they agree, but because they’ve learned what disobedience costs.

space_fan limps in silence, her brace tight, refusing help until her foot wobbles and she accepts it anyway.
Elv stays beside her, steady pace, not talking.
Rally keeps his eyes forward, shoulders tense, as if the path might change beneath him.
WavyDragons mutters, “I hate that we just… do what it says.”
CharliSpirit whispers, “I hate that I’m relieved to be told what to do.”

They expect dorm doors.

They don’t get dorm doors.

The path carries them into a massive glass dome.

And everyone stops.

Outside the dome is not darkness.

Outside the dome is water—an endless ocean pressed against the glass, full of slow-moving shadows and pale drifting shapes. Sea creatures glide past like this place is an aquarium the size of a world.

For a moment, grief loosens its grip.

GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur presses his palm to the glass. “No way…”
He shifts, and a small duck sits tucked under his arm like a pet. “Deino, you seeing this?”
Lysrix actually smiles for half a second. “Okay… that insane.”
Shroud tilts his head, quiet. “They built an ocean around us.”
Vanarknees exhales, almost awed despite himself. “That… beautiful.”
lumallie whispers, “Don’t let it distract you. That the point.”
Acoustyx scans the seams of the dome. “Still a cage.”
Nightmare just watches the water like it entertainment. “Yeah. Nice view.”

They’re wowing, breathing, almost forgetting—

until kiwi and Polaris see it.

A rubber duck figure floats outside the dome, perfectly still in the ocean-dark. Not drifting like the others. Not bobbing.

It upright.

And somehow… its beak is angled directly at them.

Polaris goes cold.
kiwi stomach drops.

And then the flashbacks hit—hard, wrong, vivid.

Day 1. Floodlights. The platform. The crowd.

In the memory, the duck figure was there the whole time—standing behind the lights, watching them.
In the memory, it was closer than it should’ve been.
In the memory, it was looking at them exactly like this.

Polaris whispers without moving her lips, “That wasn’t there.”
kiwi breathes, “I remember it.”
Polaris’ eyes flick to him. “So do I.”

They don’t tell anyone. They choose silence like it armor.

A table rises from the floor with a soft mechanical sigh—desserts laid out neatly, almost cheerful.

Duccarian voice returns like nothing is wrong.

“Feast. You’ve earned sugar.”

WavyDragons stares at the desserts like they’re a trap with frosting. “I hate that I want it.”
Rally takes a piece anyway. “Eat. We need energy.”
space_fan lowers herself into a seat carefully. “If it poison, it late.”
Elv hands her a napkin without a word.
CharliSpirit takes a small bite and closes her eyes. “Okay… okay, that good.”
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur nudges Deino closer to the table like he sharing the moment. “Don’t judge me, Deino.”
Lysrix laughs once, breathy and tired. “We’re bonding with ducks. Great.”
Shroud watches Nightmare instead of the food. “You’re too calm.”
Nightmare finally looks away from the dome. “I’m fine.”

When they finish, they feel it before it happens—the familiar dim, the shift in air.

The dome lights fade.

The floor path-lights ignite again.

Bedtime.

No speeches. No games. Just the quiet machinery of control.

They walk back slower now, guiding the injured without needing to be told.

Elv keeps space_fan steady by the elbow.
Rally stays near JIKOSU, watching his shoulder like it might fail.
Vanarknees hangs back, face unreadable.
lumallie walks with her hands clenched, like she trying not to remember.
Acoustyx keeps scanning corners out of habit.
GalaxyTwentea Dinosaur carries Deino carefully.
CharliSpirit stays close to Lysrix.
Shroud takes the rear.

Polaris and kiwi walk side by side, and neither looks at the water again.

They reach the dorms.

They sleep.

Or at least, most of them do.

Because in the dark, kiwi dreams return him to Day 1—floodlights, platform, and that upright duck watching from the glare.
And Polaris wakes with her heart pounding, certain she heard a squeak that didn’t come from any speaker.

Neither of them says a word.

Not yet.
