[[DAY]]
DAY 1 — HOW DID WE GET HERE?

[[NARRATIVE]]
The Peeps wake up one by one in a square clearing of unnatural grass.
The sky looks artificial.
The air feels staged.
No one remembers how they arrived.

They rub their eyes, hoping this is a dream.
It is not.

Aurora’s Rest is the only safe place.
Beyond it stands The Maze.

Confusion. Suspicion. Fear.

Aurora’s Rest feels “safe” in the way a display case is safe—because it’s controlled. The grass is too uniform, too square, each blade the same length like it was printed instead of grown. When you kneel, the soil doesn’t smell like soil. It smells faintly of clean water and metal, like a machine pretending to be a field.

The Maze towers on all sides: stone walls so tall they cut the sky into thin strips. Vines drape over seams that look engineered, not natural—hairline joins that run like stitched scars. Sometimes a low groan crawls up through the ground, and dust shakes loose from cracks as if something huge is shifting its weight behind the walls. The light never “moves” like sunlight. It just exists, stable and perfect, like a ceiling lamp someone forgot to turn off.

They know NOTHING. No rules. No jobs. No reason.

Just fifteen strangers on a square of fake grass, surrounded by a structure that feels like it’s listening.

Rally mally pushes to his feet first, wiping his palms on his pants like routine might summon memory. “Okay. Nobody sprints. Nobody separates. First thing—names.”
Nightmare stands without a word, eyes traveling the walls like he’s already choosing where the first death would happen.
Elvvusz squints up at the sky and exhales. “This is indoors.”
Duccarian turns in a slow circle, calm in a way that makes people uneasy, as if he’s waiting for a cue.
Kiwi tilts his head and scans the vines. “This place feels watched. Like… cameras without cameras.”
GalaxyTwentea(dino enthusiast) pinches a clump of grass, sniffs it, and grimaces. “This is fake. I don’t trust anything that pretends this hard.”
-MAD$- tests the ground with his heel, then the air, then the sound. “We stay on the grass until we know what crossing the stone does.”
janhk. crouches at the edge where grass meets wall and runs a fingertip along a seam. “These walls were assembled. That means they move.”
Ninnginni looks around like it’s a stage, gives a half-smile that covers nerves. “Aurora’s Rest, huh? That’s what we’re calling this little square of existential dread?”
Ut doesn’t speak yet—he just walks the perimeter slowly, counting steps under his breath, building a map in his head.
Axlot goes straight to the wall and slams it once. “Solid.” He hits it again, harder, like strength can make a door appear.
Popcorn Rya turns in a slow circle, eyes glassy. “Do you remember falling asleep?”
pinkfml stares down at her hands like she’s checking she’s real. “This is too clean. Dreams aren’t this consistent.”
space fan hugs herself, then forces a shaky laugh. “So… welcome to the world’s worst escape room?”
Lysrix sits up last, slower than the others. She blinks at the sky, then the walls, then the people—like she’s reading a pattern and trying not to show it. “If this is a test,” she says quietly, “it started before we woke up.”

They name the place because naming it feels like control.

GalaxyTwentea points at the square. “Aurora’s Rest. Fine. But what’s out there?”
Everyone looks to the walls.

The Maze gives them nothing back.

The first hour: trying to invent order

Rally mally starts assigning structure like it’s oxygen. “Pairs. Not romantic, not friendly. Functional. If you faint, your pair notices.”
-MAD$- backs him instantly. “And nobody touches the walls alone.”
Elvvusz nods. “We need a water source. Food. Shade. Anything.”
Ninnginni raises an eyebrow. “This is a lawn. The shade is psychological.”
Nightmare finally speaks, flat. “Stop talking like we have choices.”
Axlot snorts. “We do. We can break the wall.”
janhk. doesn’t look up. “Not with your hands you can’t.”

Ut finishes his first perimeter loop and points to the corners. “It’s a perfect square. Someone designed this.”
Kiwi answers immediately. “Designed squares are for observation. Corners are for cameras.”

space fan glances at the quieter ones—Lysrix, janhk., Ut, and Duccarian. They’ve drifted slightly away from the forming center group, not fully isolating, but not joining either.

Lysrix sits near the edge, eyes fixed on the Maze like she’s listening with her whole body.
Ut keeps measuring, calm but distant.
janhk. studies seams like they’re sentences.
Duccarian stands still, hands loose, expression unreadable.

space fan hesitates—then walks over, careful not to intrude. “Hey. Are you guys… okay?”
Duccarian answers first, quiet. “Define okay.”
Lysrix doesn’t look away from the walls. “We’re contained.”
Ut says, “Contained with intent.”
janhk. taps a seam. “Contained with mechanisms.”

space fan swallows. “Cool. Love that for us.”

Midday: the Maze “breathes” for the first time

A deep groan rolls through the ground—longer than before. The grass trembles. Dust shakes from the wall seams.

Popcorn Rya jumps. “That was the wall moving.”
Elvvusz steadies her by instinct. “Breathe. Don’t run.”
Nightmare’s eyes sharpen. “Something’s about to open.”

Then it happens.

A section of the Maze wall—far side—shifts with a slow grinding roar. A narrow slit appears, just wide enough to show darkness beyond. Not a gate. Not welcoming. A wound in the stone.

Axlot steps forward immediately. “There.”
Rally mally snaps, “STOP. We don’t know if that’s a door or a mouth.”
-MAD$- adds, “If it opens, it’s because it wants us to go.”

GalaxyTwentea whispers like he’s watching a dinosaur enclosure. “That’s the Maze inviting us.”
Ninnginni mutters, “Inviting is generous. It’s daring us.”

Kiwi squints hard. “There’s airflow now. Cold. And… listen.”
They all listen.

From inside the slit, there’s a faint sound—like metal dragging far away.

Lysrix stands up without meaning to, drawn by it. “That’s not wind.”
Duccarian finally moves, stepping closer to the edge of Aurora’s Rest but not crossing it. “That’s a schedule.”
Ut stops pacing. “The opening is timed.”
janhk. nods once. “And it will close whether you’re done or not.”

The first exploration: one foot off safety

Rally mally takes a breath. “Nobody goes alone. We send one scout team to the threshold only. Not inside.”
Nightmare smiles faintly. “Coward rule.”
Rally mally meets his gaze. “Smart rule.”

The scout team ends up being: Ut (because he already mapped), Kiwi (because he sees patterns), and Elvvusz (because he stays calm). space fan insists on following—“because if something happens, someone should be able to talk like a person.”

They move together toward the slit, step by step. The air gets colder the closer they get to the stone. Their voices feel smaller, like the Maze eats sound.

At the exact line where grass ends and stone begins, Ut stops. “This is the threshold.”
Kiwi crouches and runs fingers over the stone. “It’s smoother here. Worn. Lots of traffic.”
Elvvusz doesn’t touch anything. He just watches the slit like it might blink.

space fan whispers, “Do we step over?”
Ut answers, “Not yet.”

Behind them, Galaxy calls out from Aurora’s Rest, “If you die, I’m naming the wall after you.”
Ninnginni adds, “Make it something classy.”
Axlot growls, “Just go.”

Lysrix stays back, but her eyes never leave the slit. Her face looks like she’s remembering something she doesn’t have.

Duccarian doesn’t follow. He watches from the square, calm again. “If it wants you in there, it’ll open wider.”

Small human moments in an inhuman place

Hours pass without a real “sun” moving, but their bodies keep time anyway.

Rally mally starts a crude headcount routine and repeats it twice just to prove the number doesn’t change.

-MAD$- tests the grass in different spots like he expects a trapdoor.

janhk. collects tiny pebbles from the wall seam and lines them in a pattern, marking where the wall “breathes” strongest.

Ninnginni tries to joke less and listen more, watching who flinches at which sounds.

Nightmare circles the group like a wolf that’s pretending to be a teammate, measuring reactions.

Axlot keeps returning to the wall to hit it, softer now, like he’s trying to hear what’s behind it.

Popcorn Rya sits with her knees up and watches the sky for any “normal” change, voice small: “I miss clouds.”

pinkfml keeps checking her own pulse like she doesn’t trust it.

GalaxyTwentea starts calling the square “Aurora’s Rest” so often it becomes real, then sits down and draws a dinosaur in the grass again—because some part of him refuses to let the place take humor too.

Elvvusz quietly organizes a simple “stay close” rule and gets people to agree without raising his voice.

space fan moves between groups, checking on people, forcing little conversations to keep panic from becoming silent.

Ut makes a second, more careful map in his head, then shares it with Rally mally in a few precise sentences.

Kiwi keeps staring at the slit as if he expects it to spell something out.

And Lysrix—Lysrix watches everyone, then the Maze, then everyone again, like she’s trying to figure out what the system wants most: bodies, or choices.

As the “day” ends (not with sunset, but with the light cooling by a few degrees), the slit in the Maze closes with the same grinding certainty it opened with.

No warning. No mercy.

Just stone sealing itself like a lid.

Rally mally exhales through clenched teeth. “Okay,” he says. “So it opens. It closes. It wants us to notice.”

Nightmare’s voice is almost pleased. “Good. Now we can start playing.”

Lysrix finally speaks again, quiet enough that only the nearest Peeps hear it.

“It’s not a place,” she says. “It’s a machine.”

And Day 1 ends not with sleep, not with comfort—
but with fifteen people in Aurora’s Rest realizing they’ve been placed inside something that has a rhythm.

And rhythms always become rules.

The light doesn’t move like a sun. It doesn’t arc or soften. It just… stays. Hour after hour—same brightness, same angleless glow.

At first it’s comforting. Then it becomes pressure.

Time stretches in Aurora’s Rest the way it stretches in a waiting room: your body insists hours have passed, but the sky refuses to confirm it. Stomachs can’t agree on morning or evening. Eyes start playing tricks—micro-motions in the vines, tiny shifts in shadow that aren’t really shifts. Even blinking feels suspicious, like the place is counting it.

Rally mally tries to anchor them anyway. “We need time markers. We make our own.”
janhk. nods and scratches shallow lines into the soil near one of the sad trees—one notch for every time the wall groans.
Ut builds a second system: stone piles at the corners, rearranged after each “breath,” a crude clock made of repetition.
-MAD$- forces everyone to ration the only thing they actually have—movement. “Conserve energy. No pacing for no reason.”

Nightmare hates it. “We’re not conserving. We’re waiting.”
Elvvusz answers calmly, “Waiting is surviving when you have no information.”
Ninnginni mutters, “I’d like information. Preferably with snacks.”

GalaxyTwentea(dino enthusiast) starts naming things just to keep his brain from dissolving. He points to one of the sad trees. “That one’s Tree A.”
Popcorn Rya smiles for a second—small and real. “What about the other three?”
GalaxyTwentea thinks hard. “Tree B. Tree C. Tree D. I’m not a poet.”
pinkfml exhales, almost laughing, then clamps her mouth shut like laughing might trigger something.
space fan takes that tiny moment and runs with it. “Okay, fine—Tree D is… ‘Dave.’”

They do it because it helps. Because it makes the square feel less like a lab enclosure and more like a place they’re allowed to stand in.

Duccarian doesn’t join the joking. He watches it like it’s data. “Humor is how people stop panicking long enough to make mistakes.”

Lysrix looks at him. “Or how they stop panicking long enough to survive.”
Duccarian’s expression doesn’t change. “Same outcome. Different narrative.”

The second “breath”: the wall tests them

The Maze groans again.

This time, the grass trembles longer—like the whole structure below them shifted, not just the seam near the slit. For a heartbeat the air feels thinner, like oxygen got measured and reduced.

Ut freezes mid-step. “Did the boundary move?”
janhk. is already at the edge, fingertip hovering over the stone line. “No… but something underneath did.”
Kiwi whispers, “Like a train passed under us.”
Rally mally’s voice tightens. “Everyone back to center.”

Axlot ignores him and walks toward the wall. “If it’s moving, I want to see it.”
Rally mally snaps, “Axlot—”
Nightmare says, almost amused, “Let him.”

Axlot reaches the seam.

For a second, nothing happens.

Then a tiny click—mechanical, polite—like a lock acknowledging a key that wasn’t used correctly.

A thin strip of boundary stone lights up, faint and white, tracing a line along the grass edge.

Axlot jerks back. “What the—”
space fan’s voice spikes. “It reacts to proximity.”

The light stays on for exactly five seconds.

Then goes dead.

Lysrix’s eyes narrow. “A warning.”
Elvvusz nods. “Or an instruction.”
-MAD$- says, “Or a rule we don’t understand yet.”

Food arrives like an insult

Much later—so much later their bodies start misfiring hunger signals—something finally changes.

A panel in the ground near the trees hisses open.

A small tray rises.

Not a feast. Not even a meal.

A handful of dry nutrient bars. A few sealed water packets.

A little too neat.

Popcorn Rya stares at it like it’s a joke. “That’s it?”
Ninnginni picks one up and sniffs it. “Tastes like drywall. Love that.”
GalaxyTwentea(dino enthusiast) opens his and takes a bite. “Dave the Tree could cook better.”
pinkfml’s hands shake as she opens hers. “At least it’s real.”
space fan breaks hers in half without being asked and pushes a piece toward Popcorn Rya. “Here.”
Popcorn Rya blinks. “You don’t have to—”
space fan shrugs, trying to keep her voice casual. “Yeah. I do.”

Nightmare watches the exchange like it’s weakness.
Lysrix watches it like structure forming.
Rally mally nods once, approving. “Good. We share. We stay alive longer.”

Duccarian takes his portion last. “They want us functional. Not comfortable.”
Kiwi chews slowly. “Functional people make better choices.”
Lysrix says quietly, “Better choices make better data.”

The slit returns — and it’s worse

The slit in the wall opens again.

Not wider. Not friendlier. Just open.

But now they can see something new: behind the vines, the outline of a metal cage and shaft—motionless, deep, wrong. An elevator hidden in the wall like a throat with teeth.

Ut points without stepping closer. “That’s not a gate. That’s a lift.”
janhk. whispers, “Why hide an elevator inside the Maze?”
Ninnginni answers, voice dry. “Because if you put the elevator in the open, people behave rationally around it.”
Axlot scoffs. “It’s a way out.”
Lysrix shakes her head. “No. It’s a way through.”

Rally mally steps forward just enough to be heard. “Nobody touches it today. We live one day first.”
Nightmare’s eyes glitter. “You’re scared.”
Rally mally meets his stare. “I’m smart.”

Elvvusz stays with him, calm and firm. “We don’t gamble our first day.”
Duccarian murmurs, “We already are. Just by standing here.”

The slit closes again.

They don’t chase it.

Not yet.

But everyone feels it now—the sense that the place isn’t waiting for them to move.

It’s waiting for time.

For a schedule that doesn’t care what humans want.

Day 1 ends in the longest silence

They sit in groups without realizing they’ve formed them.

Rally mally, Elvvusz, and -MAD$- near the center, trying to plan without information.
Nightmare and Axlot closer to the wall, daring it to react.
Ninnginni and GalaxyTwentea(dino enthusiast) near the trees, using jokes like bandages.
Popcorn Rya and pinkfml near each other, quietly trying not to shake.
Ut and janhk. on the perimeter line, inventing measurements.
Duccarian standing in the one spot that sees everyone.
Kiwi hovering between groups, eyes on seams.
Lysrix slightly apart, watching all of them like she’s already seeing who breaks first.

Eventually the light cools by a fraction again—barely noticeable, but enough to make their skin prickle.

Not sunset.

A setting change.

A system shifting modes.

Rally mally says what everyone is thinking, voice low. “We don’t know what comes next.”
Lysrix answers, almost too calm: “We will. It will teach us.”
Duccarian adds, quiet as a final nail: “And it will charge us for the lesson.”

And Day 1 keeps going—longer than it should—until even the idea of “day” feels like something invented by people who lived somewhere real.

And the worst part is this:

In daylight, the Maze stays still.

It waits.

It saves its movement for the dark—when they’ll hear stone grinding against stone for the first time and realize the walls don’t “breathe” all day.

They only shift when nobody can see what’s changing.
