[[DAY]]
DAY 1 — HOW DID WE GET HERE?

[[NARRATIVE]]
The Peeps wake up one by one in a square clearing of unnatural grass.
The sky looks artificial.
The air feels staged.
No one remembers how they arrived.

They rub their eyes, hoping this is a dream.
It is not.

Aurora’s Rest is the only safe place.
Beyond it stands The Maze.

Confusion. Suspicion. Fear.

Aurora’s Rest feels “safe” in the way a display case is safe—because it’s controlled. The grass is too uniform, too square, each blade the same length like it was printed instead of grown. When you kneel, the soil doesn’t smell like soil. It smells faintly of clean water and metal, like a machine pretending to be a field.

The Maze towers on all sides: stone walls so tall they cut the sky into thin strips. Vines drape over seams that look engineered, not natural—hairline joins that run like stitched scars. Sometimes a low groan crawls up through the ground, and dust shakes loose from cracks as if something huge is shifting its weight behind the walls. The light never “moves” like sunlight. It just exists, stable and perfect, like a ceiling lamp someone forgot to turn off.

They know NOTHING. No rules. No jobs. No reason.

Just fifteen strangers on a square of fake grass, surrounded by a structure that feels like it’s listening.

Rally mally pushes to his feet first, wiping his palms on his pants like routine might summon memory. “Okay. Nobody sprints. Nobody separates. First thing—names.”
Nightmare stands without a word, eyes traveling the walls like he’s already choosing where the first death would happen.
Elvvusz squints up at the sky and exhales. “This is indoors.”
Duccarian turns in a slow circle, calm in a way that makes people uneasy, as if he’s waiting for a cue.
Alter(Kiwi) tilts his head and scans the vines. “This place feels watched. Like… cameras without cameras.”
GalaxyTwentea(dino enthusiast) pinches a clump of grass, sniffs it, and grimaces. “This is fake. I don’t trust anything that pretends this hard.”
-MAD$- tests the ground with his heel, then the air, then the sound. “We stay on the grass until we know what crossing the stone does.”
janhk. crouches at the edge where grass meets wall and runs a fingertip along a seam. “These walls were assembled. That means they move.”
Ninnginni looks around like it’s a stage, gives a half-smile that covers nerves. “Aurora’s Rest, huh? That’s what we’re calling this little square of existential dread?”
Ut doesn’t speak yet—he just walks the perimeter slowly, counting steps under his breath, building a map in his head.
Axlot goes straight to the wall and slams it once. “Solid.” He hits it again, harder, like strength can make a door appear.
Popcorn Rya turns in a slow circle, eyes glassy. “Do you remember falling asleep?”
pinkfml stares down at her hands like she’s checking she’s real. “This is too clean. Dreams aren’t this consistent.”
space fan hugs herself, then forces a shaky laugh. “So… welcome to the world’s worst escape room?”
Lysrix sits up last, slower than the others. She blinks at the sky, then the walls, then the people—like she’s reading a pattern and trying not to show it. “If this is a test,” she says quietly, “it started before we woke up.”

They name the place because naming it feels like control.

Galaxy points at the square. “Aurora’s Rest. Fine. But what’s out there?”
Everyone looks to the walls.

The Maze gives them nothing back.

The first hour: trying to invent order

Rally mally starts assigning structure like it’s oxygen. “Pairs. Not romantic, not friendly. Functional. If you faint, your pair notices.”
-MAD$- backs him instantly. “And nobody touches the walls alone.”
Elvvusz nods. “We need a water source. Food. Shade. Anything.”
Ninnginni raises an eyebrow. “This is a lawn. The shade is psychological.”
Nightmare finally speaks, flat. “Stop talking like we have choices.”
Axlot snorts. “We do. We can break the wall.”
janhk. doesn’t look up. “Not with your hands you can’t.”

Ut finishes his first perimeter loop and points to the corners. “It’s a perfect square. Someone designed this.”
Alter(Kiwi) answers immediately. “Designed squares are for observation. Corners are for cameras.”

space fan glances at the quieter ones—Lysrix, janhk., Ut, and Duccarian. They’ve drifted slightly away from the forming center group, not fully isolating, but not joining either.

Lysrix sits near the edge, eyes fixed on the Maze like she’s listening with her whole body.
Ut keeps measuring, calm but distant.
janhk. studies seams like they’re sentences.
Duccarian stands still, hands loose, expression unreadable.

space fan hesitates—then walks over, careful not to intrude. “Hey. Are you guys… okay?”
Duccarian answers first, quiet. “Define okay.”
Lysrix doesn’t look away from the walls. “We’re contained.”
Ut says, “Contained with intent.”
janhk. taps a seam. “Contained with mechanisms.”

space fan swallows. “Cool. Love that for us.”

Midday: the Maze “breathes” for the first time

A deep groan rolls through the ground—longer than before. The grass trembles. Dust shakes from the wall seams.

Popcorn Rya jumps. “That was the wall moving.”
Elvvusz steadies her by instinct. “Breathe. Don’t run.”
Nightmare’s eyes sharpen. “Something’s about to open.”

Then it happens.

A section of the Maze wall—far side—shifts with a slow grinding roar. A narrow slit appears, just wide enough to show darkness beyond. Not a gate. Not welcoming. A wound in the stone.

Axlot steps forward immediately. “There.”
Rally mally snaps, “STOP. We don’t know if that’s a door or a mouth.”
-MAD$- adds, “If it opens, it’s because it wants us to go.”

GalaxyTwentea whispers like he’s watching a dinosaur enclosure. “That’s the Maze inviting us.”
Ninnginni mutters, “Inviting is generous. It’s daring us.”

Alter(Kiwi) squints hard. “There’s airflow now. Cold. And… listen.”
They all listen.

From inside the slit, there’s a faint sound—like metal dragging far away.

Lysrix stands up without meaning to, drawn by it. “That’s not wind.”
Duccarian finally moves, stepping closer to the edge of Aurora’s Rest but not crossing it. “That’s a schedule.”
Ut stops pacing. “The opening is timed.”
janhk. nods once. “And it will close whether you’re done or not.”

The first exploration: one foot off safety

Rally mally takes a breath. “Nobody goes alone. We send one scout team to the threshold only. Not inside.”
Nightmare smiles faintly. “Coward rule.”
Rally mally meets his gaze. “Smart rule.”

The scout team ends up being: Ut (because he already mapped), Alter(Kiwi) (because he sees patterns), and Elvvusz (because he stays calm). space fan insists on following—“because if something happens, someone should be able to talk like a person.”

They move together toward the slit, step by step. The air gets colder the closer they get to the stone. Their voices feel smaller, like the Maze eats sound.

At the exact line where grass ends and stone begins, Ut stops. “This is the threshold.”
Alter(Kiwi) crouches and runs fingers over the stone. “It’s smoother here. Worn. Lots of traffic.”
Elvvusz doesn’t touch anything. He just watches the slit like it might blink.

space fan whispers, “Do we step over?”
Ut answers, “Not yet.”

Behind them, Galaxy calls out from Aurora’s Rest, “If you die, I’m naming the wall after you.”
Ninnginni adds, “Make it something classy.”
Axlot growls, “Just go.”

Lysrix stays back, but her eyes never leave the slit. Her face looks like she’s remembering something she doesn’t have.

Duccarian doesn’t follow. He watches from the square, calm again. “If it wants you in there, it’ll open wider.”

Small human moments in an inhuman place

Hours pass without a real “sun” moving, but their bodies keep time anyway.

Rally mally starts a crude headcount routine and repeats it twice just to prove the number doesn’t change.

-MAD$- tests the grass in different spots like he expects a trapdoor.

janhk. collects tiny pebbles from the wall seam and lines them in a pattern, marking where the wall “breathes” strongest.

Ninnginni tries to joke less and listen more, watching who flinches at which sounds.

Nightmare circles the group like a wolf that’s pretending to be a teammate, measuring reactions.

Axlot keeps returning to the wall to hit it, softer now, like he’s trying to hear what’s behind it.

Popcorn Rya sits with her knees up and watches the sky for any “normal” change, voice small: “I miss clouds.”

pinkfml keeps checking her own pulse like she doesn’t trust it.

GalaxyTwentea starts calling the square “Aurora’s Rest” so often it becomes real, then sits down and draws a dinosaur in the grass again—because some part of him refuses to let the place take humor too.

Elvvusz quietly organizes a simple “stay close” rule and gets people to agree without raising his voice.

space fan moves between groups, checking on people, forcing little conversations to keep panic from becoming silent.

Ut makes a second, more careful map in his head, then shares it with Rally mally in a few precise sentences.

Alter(Kiwi) keeps staring at the slit as if he expects it to spell something out.

And Lysrix—Lysrix watches everyone, then the Maze, then everyone again, like she’s trying to figure out what the system wants most: bodies, or choices.

As the “day” ends (not with sunset, but with the light cooling by a few degrees), the slit in the Maze closes with the same grinding certainty it opened with.

No warning. No mercy.

Just stone sealing itself like a lid.

Rally mally exhales through clenched teeth. “Okay,” he says. “So it opens. It closes. It wants us to notice.”

Nightmare’s voice is almost pleased. “Good. Now we can start playing.”

Lysrix finally speaks again, quiet enough that only the nearest Peeps hear it.

“It’s not a place,” she says. “It’s a machine.”

And Day 1 ends not with sleep, not with comfort—
but with fifteen people in Aurora’s Rest realizing they’ve been placed inside something that has a rhythm.

And rhythms always become rules.
